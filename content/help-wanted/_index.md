If you were looking for issues where your expertise is needed, search no more! This list features issues for rOpenSci packages specifically labelled as "Help wanted" (meaning the package developer is actively soliciting help).

Always comment on an issue before tackling it to ensure the maintainer is still hoping for a contribution, and that no one else is already working on it.
              
If you're just getting started with making contributions, check out the issues labelled "Good first issue", as a way to ease into the process. Remember that not all issues require code contributions, sometimes it's documentation, use cases, vignettes, etc.
               
See also our [contributing guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) for finding other ways to contribute to rOpenSci.
