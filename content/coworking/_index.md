**Join us for social coworking & office hours monthly on first Tuesdays! 
Hosted by [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte) and various community hosts. 
Everyone welcome. 
No registration needed.**

We meet for two hours, introduce ourselves and cowork. You can choose to 
work on your own or socialize by choosing different 'rooms' (Quiet or Noisy). 
Each session has a theme and the opportunity to explore that theme with the 
community host in the Noisy room.

**Have suggestions for future themes? Interested in being a community host?**  

Contact [Steffi](/author/steffi-lazerte) on the rOpenSci Slack, Mastodon, 
or our Community Manager, [Yani](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene), 
and let us know! 
If you're interested in hosting but aren't sure of a theme, we're happy to 
help you come up with one!
