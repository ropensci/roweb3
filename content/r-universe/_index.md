[R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) is our platform for improving publication and discovery of research software in R.

R-universe allows users and developers of R packages to...

* **Discover**: R-universe provides a searchable catalogue for R software, articles, datasets, anywhere in the ecosystem. That catalogue is indexed and ranked using R specific features.

* **Learn**: R-universe serves rendered material and extensive background information to learn about a package and get started using it.

* **Publish**: R-universe is an open platform for running personal cran-like package repositories to make your work visible and accessible to a big audience, with or without CRAN.

* **Develop**: R-universe provides a zero config development environment for continuous integration (identify upcoming breakage before the release), experimental R features, new platforms such as WebAssembly, etc.
