**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday July 02, 14:00 European Central (12:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Git and GitHub** 
with community host **Zhian Kamvar**, a Research Software Engineer and author of
several R packages and workflows, all with Git and on GitHub!

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Read up on Git and GitHub and how they might serve you.
- Start your first Git/GitHub project!
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Zhian Kamvar**, and chat about the pros and cons of 
  Git & GitHub, resources for getting started and tips and tricks.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
