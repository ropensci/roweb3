**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday October 01, 14:00 European Central (12:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Using R to tell (data science) stories** 
with community host **Apoorv Anand**. Apoorv is a mentor in the 
rOpenSci Champions Program and often uses R to make public datasets more accessible.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Explore how others use R to tell data stories
- Start work on a project using R to craft a narrative through data
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Apoorv Anand** and discuss and explore the use of R in data stories
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
