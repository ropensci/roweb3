**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday August 01, 09:00 Americas Pacific (16:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Spatial data in R** 
with community host **Mike Mahoney**, maintainer of several spatial packages with
rOpenSci such as [waywiser](https://docs.ropensci.org/waywiser/), 
[terrainr](https://docs.ropensci.org/terrainr/) and 
[geojsonio](https://docs.ropensci.org/geojsonio/), 
as well as [spatialsample](https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/).

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Work on a project related to spatial data
- Explore R packages for working with spatial data
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Mike Mahoney**, and discuss aspects of working with spatial data in R.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
