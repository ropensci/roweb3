rOpenSci and Openscapes are lucky to have a members many U.S. federal employees
who enrich our work and community.  In a time of great uncertainty for so many
government workers, we want to support our members who are considering their
next career steps.

Join us on Tuesday, May 6 at 8:30PM EDT for a discussion and networking event
for and with current and former U.S. federal government data scientists.

We will be joined by co-hosts discussing their career paths in other sectors
after serving at U.S. federal agencies, including:

 - [Dan Pisut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danpisut/), Environmental Information and Climate Resilience Lead, ESRI (NOAA)
 - [Soumya Kalra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyakalra/), Chief Data Officer, City and County of San Francisco (Federal Reserve Bank)
 - [Julie Kellner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-kellner-913132162/), Senior Program Manager, Digital Science (NSF)
 - [Alissa Dillman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allissa-dillman/), CEO/Founder, BioDataSage (NIH)
 - [Aaron Friesz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-friesz-32a3751a6/), Technical Community Manager, Earth Science Information Partners (NASA)
 
We will hear from our co-hosts and then organize into breakout rooms for Q&A
and discussion.

If you are a former federal employee who can share and answer questions about
your post-government career path, we would love to have you join as well! Please
let us know at in the registration form your experience so we can organize
participants by topic.
