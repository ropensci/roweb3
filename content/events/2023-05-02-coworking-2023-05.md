**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday May 02, 09:00 Americas Pacific (16:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Spring Cleaning**\*
with **Steffi LaZerte**, rOpenSci's community assistant who forgets all too often
to spring clean her own packages :scream:.

\* For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere and **Fall Cleaning** for our Southern friends.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Explore how other organizations keep their scripts/packages nice and clean
- Make a plan for what you would like to check/clean
- Start cleaning!
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Chat with **Steffi LaZerte** and other attendees to discuss tips for keeping on top of it all.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
