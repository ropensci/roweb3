### Cowork

  - Look up resources on using AI *in* R (e.g., machine learning)
  - Look up resources on using AI *for* R (e.g., [RTutor](https://rtutor.ai/))
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!
