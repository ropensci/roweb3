**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday January 13, 09:00 Americas Pacific (17:00 UTC) for
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Let it go!**
with community host **Yanina Bellini Saibene**, rOpenSci community host and ruthless unsubscriber of Newsletters and Slack workspaces üòÜ.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Spend some time reviewing the forums, Slack workspaces, Newsletters, RSS feeds (etc. etc.) you're subscribed to
- Unsubscribe to all you no longer need (Let it go!)
- Cowork independently on something related to R
- Cowork on whatever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Yanina Bellini Saibene**, and discuss strategies for this New Year decluttering of your digital (or perhaps not-so-digital) life.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Ask and answer questions with the hosts and other coworkers

We host [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to
accommodate different parts of the world.
