**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday December 02, 14:00 Europe Central (13:00 UTC) for
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Getting to know The Carpentries** 
with community host **Angelique Trusler**. Angelique is passionate about equitable access to data science education and is the Associate Director of Community at The Carpentries.

These "Getting to know" themed coworking sessions give us a chance to meet and
learn about other like-minded organizations and communities whom we support,
collaborate with, or generally cheer on!

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Visit [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)
- Cowork independently on something related to R
- Cowork on whatever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Angelique Trusler**, and learn more about The Carpentries and how you might get involved.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Ask and answer questions with the hosts and other coworkers

We host [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to
accommodate different parts of the world.
