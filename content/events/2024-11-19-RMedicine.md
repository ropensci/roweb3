Containerization has become a dominant computing paradigm for computing in the past decade due to its many advantages: isolation and security, scalability and efficiency with lightweight containers sharing an operating kernel and resources, and portability across cloud computing providers. For the researcher, analyst, or R user, containers have applications ranging from reproducible analytical environments to packaging statistical code to use in web applications. I will discuss how biomedical researchers can make use of containerization technology, particularly the tools provided by the Rocker Project, which publishes powerful standardized containers for the R language.
