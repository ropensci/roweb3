**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday June 06, 09:00 Australian Western (01:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Integrating and merging datasets from different sources** 
with community host **Cynthia Huang** who has been tackling how to integrate
data from multiple sources as part of her PhD at Monash University!

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Spend time integrating datasets for your own work
- Explore how others tackle the problem of merging datasets from different sources 
  or different data versions
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Cynthia Huang**, and discuss strategies for integrating datasets.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
