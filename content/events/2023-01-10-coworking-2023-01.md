**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday January 10, 14:00 European Central (13:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Working with new R users** 
with community host **[Alex Koiter](https://alexkoiter.ca)**, who is a professor in Geography and is
enthusiastic about introducing R to undergraduate students.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Annotate a script/qmd/Rmd to help a friend/colleague/student 
- Brainstorm ideas for supporting and encouraging new R users
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you’ve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **[Alex Koiter](https://alexkoiter.ca)**, and discuss how to share the love of R
  with new R users!
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
