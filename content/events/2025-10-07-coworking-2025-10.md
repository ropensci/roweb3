**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday October 07, 09:00 Americas Pacific (16:00 UTC) for
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme 
**Ship your R package to the [R-multiverse](https://r-multiverse.org)!**
with community host **Will Landau**, co-creator of R-multiverse and author of 
the [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets) R package, 
and **Ma√´lle Salmon**, rOpenSci Research Software Engineer and one of the 
R-multiverse administrators.

During this coworking event, participants will learn about submitting packages
to the R-multiverse and will be encouraged to do so during the session 
(but regular coworkers are always welcome).

Afterwards, Ma√´lle will write an rOpenSci blog post about the event, 
highlighting how things went and which packages were submitted.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Cowork independently on something related to R
- Cowork on whatever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

We host [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)

accommodate different parts of the world.
