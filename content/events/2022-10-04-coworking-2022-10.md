**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday, October 4th, 9 AM Australian Western / 1:00 UTC for<br>[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This October we're focusing on the theme **Start writing that package!** 
with community host **Nick Tierney**, R enthusiast and author of several R packages.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork...

- Get started on that package!
- Cowork independently on work related to R
  - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
  - What ever you need to get done!
  
### Socialize/Network... 

- Meet community host, **Nick Tierney**, and discuss how to get started
- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
  - Ask your hosts
  - Ask your fellow developers
  - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other developers questions!

We host [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating times to accommodate different parts of the world.
