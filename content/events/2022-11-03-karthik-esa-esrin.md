Our Project Lead and co-founder Karthik Ram gave a talk on Open Source Ecosystems (OSEs) at the Open Innovation for Earth Observation Programmes workshop organized by ESA and NASA in Frascati. 

In this talk, Karthik describe how The rOpenSci Project began as a small club (using Nadia Asparouhovaâ€™s terminology) and grew into a modest federation by engaging the community collaboration models described by CSCCE. We started out by conveying tools, then accepting contributions, collaborating with researchers via the peer-review system, and finally enabling co-creation via the r-universe. Karthik then cover how organizations like space agencies can stand up lightweight OSPOs to start, and use metrics (like those from CHAOSS) to help open-source projects thrive and succeed. Karthik then cover the various factors necessary to turn a nascent project into an OSE from early conversations as part of my newly funded POSE training program.
