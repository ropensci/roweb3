tips: |
  You can subscribe to rOpenSci-led events via [our ICS calendar](/events/index.ics) (copy the link, add it to your calendar service e.g. [Thunderbird](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/creating-new-calendars#w_on-the-network-connect-to-your-online-calendars) or Google Calendar). If you use Google Calendar, [check that synchronization is turned on](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/syncselect) and note that synchronization might be delayed. When _opening_ .ics files on OSX, you might need to [change settings](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3509/can-i-set-os-x-to-automatically-open-ics-files-in-ical).
