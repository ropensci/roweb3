**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday November 07, 09:00 Americas Pacific (17:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Fixing scary bugs üò± üêõ** 
with community host **Salix Dubois**, maintainer of the rOpenSci [bold](https://docs.ropensci.org/bold) package.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Identify some scary bugs to fix (maybe [ask for help](/blog/2023/09/19/help-wanted/)!)
- Fix some scary bugs (in your packages/scripts, or chat with a maintainer about helping them)
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Salix Dubois**, and discuss tips and tricks for identifying and fixing scary bugs.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
