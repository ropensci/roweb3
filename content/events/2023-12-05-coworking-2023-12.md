**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday December 05, 09:00 Australian Western (01:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Why won't it pass?! Troubleshooting R package checks** 
with community host **Adam Sparks**, maintainer of rOpenSci packages [GSODR](https://docs.ropensci.org/GSODR/)
and [nasapower](https://docs.ropensci.org/nasapower/) 
and one who has the dubious honour of having troubleshooted **many** problematic
package checks üò∏.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Explore what R package checks are and where they might fail
- Work on an R package and run some checks
- Spend some time troubleshooting your own failing package checks
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Adam Sparks**, and discuss tips and tricks for troubleshooting package checks
- Try some group troubleshooting on failing checks you just can't figure out
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
