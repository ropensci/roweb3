For a decade, rOpenSci has made software peer-review the linchpin of their project of improving open-software scientific software, using it as a mechanism to develop technology, skills, collaboration, and building a diverse and inclusive community of researchers and developers.

Noam Ross will discuss lessons learned and how researchers can participate in a gain from working with the rOpenSci community.
