**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday December 03, 09:00 Australian Western (01:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Getting Involved in the Antarctic/Southern Ocean rOpenSci Community** 
with community hosts **Michael Sumner and Ben Raymond**. 
Michael and Ben each maintain several rOpenSci packages for spatial and ocean research and 
analyses, and both are also part
of the [Antarctic/Southern Ocean rOpenSci community](/blog/2018/11/13/antarctic/).
This is a special community within rOpenSci which promotes the development of 
software to support open science in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- [Explore rOpenSci R packages](/blog/2018/11/13/antarctic/#demo) supporting Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research
- [Get involved](/blog/2018/11/13/antarctic/#get-involved) in the community
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community hosts, **Michael Sumner and Ben Raymond**, and find out how you can be involved in this community
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
