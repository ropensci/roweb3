**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday, January 4th, 9 AM Pacific / 16:00 UTC for our first official Social Coworking + Office Hours event.**

Following our label-athon experiments we will be hosting [Social Coworking + Office Hour sessions](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) on the first Tuesday of the month. 

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Cowork independently on work related to R
  - Plan out that package you've always wanted to create
  - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
  - Make your packages more contributor-friendly (create issues, write a road map, etc.)
  - What ever you need to get done!
- Get answers to your questions
  - Ask rOpenSci staff
  - Ask your fellow developers
  - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other developers questions!
