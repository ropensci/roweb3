**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday June 04, 09:00 Australian Western (01:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **R in the Wild** 
with a team of community hosts! **Ernest Guevarra, Tom√°s Zaba, 
Nicholus Tint Zaw, and Zython Paul Lachica**, all of whom use R workflows in the wild for
work either on their own or with teams.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Work on some of your own workflows
- Explore how you might incorporate R workflows in your own work
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet our community hosts, and discuss R workflows in the wild!
- Discuss challenges of incorporating R workflows on your own in the workplace
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
