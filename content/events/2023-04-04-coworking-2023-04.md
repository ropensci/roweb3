**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday April 04, 14:00 European Central (12:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Working with taxonomic lists in R** 
with community host **Miguel Alvarez**, maintainer of the rOpenSci package taxlist.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Explore R packages for working with lists (such as taxlist)
- Organize some taxonomy in your data using taxlist
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host **Miguel Alvarez** and discuss tips for working with taxonomic lists.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
