**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday February 07, 09:00 Americas Pacific (17:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)** 
with community host **[Hugo Gruson](/author/hugo-gruson)**, Research Software Engineer in Epidemiology
and CI/automation addict.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Setup Continuous Integration on one (or more) of your projects
- Look up resources for getting started or plan out what you want to do
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **[Hugo Gruson](/author/hugo-gruson)**, and discuss how [Continuous Integration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)
  can simplify your development process and how to set it up
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
