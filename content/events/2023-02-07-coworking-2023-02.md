**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday February 07, 09:00 Americas Pacific (17:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Setting up Continuous Integration** 
with community host **Hugo Gruson**, Research Software Engineer in Epidemiology.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Setup Continuous Integration on one (or more) of your projects
- Look up resources for getting started or plan out what you want to do
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you’ve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Hugo Gruson**, and discuss different ways of setting up 
  Continuous Integration
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
