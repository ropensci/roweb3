**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday April 07, 09:00 Americas Pacific (16:00 UTC) for
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Getting to know the Climate Sensitive Infectious Disease (CSID) Network**
with community host **Irene Ramos**, *something about Irene* and the Head of Membership for the CSID.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Visit the [CSID Network](https://csidnet.org/)
- Cowork independently on something related to R
- Cowork on whatever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Irene Ramos**, and learn more about the CSID Network and how you might get involved.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Ask and answer questions with the hosts and other coworkers

We host [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to
accommodate different parts of the world.
