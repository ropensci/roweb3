We’re following up our Community Call - [Set Up Your Package to Foster a Community](/commcalls/apr2021-pkg-community/) - with an experiment!

**Join us for 1.5 hours Thursday, May 13th, 5 PM Pacific / Friday May 14th 00:00 UTC for our second co-working “label-athon”.**

- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Co-work independently, implementing some of [our recommendations](/commcalls/apr2021-pkg-community/) for what you can add/modify in your own package to encourage community participation
  - Code of Conduct
  - Contributing guide 
  - Roadmap and expectations
  - Open and label issues to invite contributions
- Get answers to your questions

At the end of the session we’ll tweet links to your “[help wanted](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)” issues to help you get attention to your project.

Our experiment includes 4 label-athons (if y’all show up, we can do more) at alternating times to accommodate our community around the world. Thursdays April 29, May 13, May 27, June 10.

[Registration](https://form.jotform.com/211236716589260) is encouraged.
