**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday October 03, 14:00 European Central (12:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Creating nice command-line interfaces with cli**

R package developer, and cognitive neuroscientist!

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Read up on making nice command line interfaces with [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/)
- Update some scripts or packages to include cleaner and effective interfaces
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you’ve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Athanasia Mo Mowinckel**, and discuss effective interfaces.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)

accommodate different parts of the world.
