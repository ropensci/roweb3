**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday March 04, 14:00 European Central (13:00 UTC) for 
a special coworking event.**

This is the second of two **mini hackathons** we'll be hosting to **[Support First Time
Contributors to Open Source Software](/blog/2025/01/21/coworking-hackathons/#mini-hackathons)**.
If you're curious about contributing to Open Source Software, and would like 
some support to get started, this event is for you!

During this session you'll join others making contributions to R packages 
while [package maintainers and other mentors](/blog/2024/10/22/first-time-contributions/) 
are available 'live' to answer questions and give guidance. 

We'll also have a special Slack channel ready as a place for asynchronous questions 
during the event and in the week following.

These collaborative events are designed to help first-time contributors get started with open-source projects.
Whether you're improving documentation, reviewing translations, fixing bugs, or adding new features, our mentors will guide you every step of the way. 

**No prior experience required. Non-first time contributors are very welcome too‚Äîjust bring your curiosity and enthusiasm!**

Registration is appreciated but **not required**!
Please fill out this [short form](https://airtable.com/appRpJelSoXWcYCG1/pagXLEueuI2o3GuBQ/form) to sign up.

If you register, we'll send out reminders and more details about the event closer to the date.
