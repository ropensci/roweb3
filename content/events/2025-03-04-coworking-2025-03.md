**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday March 04, 14:00 European Central (13:00 UTC) for 
a special coworking event.**

This is the second of two **mini hackathons** we'll be hosting to **Support First Time
Contributors to Open Source Software.** 
If you're curious about contributing to Open Source Software, and would like 
some support to get started, this event is for you!

During this session you'll join others making contributions to R packages 
while [package maintainers and other mentors](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/10/22/first-time-contributions/) 
are available 'live' to answer questions and give guidance. 

We'll also have a special Slack channel ready as a place for asynchronous questions 
during the event and in the week following.

**While these events are designed to support first time contributors, any and all 
contributors are welcome!**

Note that this event requires registration.
Please fill out this [short form](https://airtable.com/appRpJelSoXWcYCG1/pagXLEueuI2o3GuBQ/form) to sign up.

We'll send out reminders, some information to get you started, and a Zoom link closer to the date.
