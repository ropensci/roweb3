We're back!

**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday, September 6th, 9 AM North American Pacific / 16:00 UTC for [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This September we're focusing on the theme **Teaching with R** with our new community manager, 
**Yanina Bellini Saibene**, as co-host!

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork...

- Prepare some lessons on/with R for teaching
- Learn teaching-related R packages
- Cowork independently on work related to R
  - Plan out that package you've always wanted to create
  - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
  - What ever you need to get done!
  
### Socialize/Network...

- Meet co-host **Yanina Bellini Saibene**, and chat about teaching experiences, tips and tricks, or favourite R lessons
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
  - Ask your hosts
  - Ask your fellow attendees
  - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other attendees' questions!

We host [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating times to accommodate different parts of the world.
