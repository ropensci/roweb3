**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday June 03, 14:00 European Central (12:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Getting to know DSLC** 
with community host **Jon Harmon**. Jon is an rOpenSci package maintainer, Data Scientist,
and the Executive Director for the Data Science Learning Community.

These "Getting to know" themed coworking sessions give us a chance to meet and
learn about other like-minded organizations and communities whom we support,
collaborate with, or generally cheer on!

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Look up [DSLC](https://dslc.io)
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Jon Harmon**, learn more about the Data Science Learning Community and how you might get involved.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
