**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday, March 1st, 9 AM North American Pacific / 17:00 UTC for<br>[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This March we're focusing on the theme **Changing package maintainers** with community host
**Hannah Owens**, who recently took over maintenance of the [rOpenSci spocc package](https://docs.ropensci.org/spocc/).

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork...

- Ensure your R packages are understandable to potential collaborators (or future maintainers)
- Cowork independently on work related to R
  - Plan out that package you've always wanted to create
  - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
  - What ever you need to get done!
  
### Socialize/Network...

- Meet our community host, **Hannah Owens**, and ask about her experience taking over maintenance of the [rOpenSci spocc package](https://docs.ropensci.org/spocc/).
- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
  - Ask rOpenSci staff
  - Ask your fellow developers
  - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other developers questions!

We host [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating times to accommodate different parts of the world.
