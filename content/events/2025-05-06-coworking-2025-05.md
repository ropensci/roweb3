**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday May 06, 09:00 Australian Western (01:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Writing functions in R** 
with community host **Nick Tierney**, maintainer for numerous R packages including
several with rOpenSci.

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Write some functions
- Explore new or interesting ways of writing functions in R
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Nick Tierney**, and chat about writing functions from simple to complex!
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
