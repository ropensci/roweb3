**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday, February 1st, 9 AM Australian Western / 1:00 UTC for Social Coworking + Office Hours.**

We are hosting [Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating times to accommodate different parts of the world. 

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Cowork independently on work related to R
  - Plan out that package you've always wanted to create
  - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
  - Make your packages more [contributor-friendly](/blog/2021/04/28/commcall-pkg-community/) (create issues, write a road map, etc.)
  - What ever you need to get done!
- Get answers to your questions
  - Ask rOpenSci staff
  - Ask your fellow developers
  - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other developers questions!
