**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday March 07, 09:00 Australian Western (01:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Checking data with [naniar](https://naniar.njtierney.com/), [visdat](https://docs.ropensci.org/visdat/), 
[assertr](https://docs.ropensci.org/assertr/), and 
[skimr](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/)** 
with community host **Nick Tierney**, R enthusiast and author of several R packages (including naniar and visdat!).

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Explore documentation, use cases and tutorials on these packages
- Check your data using naniar, visdat, assertr, and/or skimr!
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you‚Äôve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Nick Tierney**, and discuss how to integrate these data checks into your workflow.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
