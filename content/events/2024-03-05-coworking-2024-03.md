**Join us for 2 hours Tuesday March 05, 09:00 Australian Western (01:00 UTC) for 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)**

This month we're focusing on the theme **Dates, Times and Timezones in R** 
with community host **Steffi LaZerte**, rOpenSci’s community assistant who 
deals with timezones way too often for comfort!

Come for the full 2 hrs or only as long as you need!

### Cowork

- Explore resources for working with dates, times, and timezones in R
- Work on a project dealing with dates and times
- Cowork independently on work related to R
    - Plan out that package you’ve always wanted to create
    - Work on packages that tend to be neglected
    - What ever you need to get done!

### Socialize/Network

- Meet community host, **Steffi LaZerte**, and discuss common problems with timezones.
- Meet other R users and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Get answers to your questions
    - Ask your hosts
    - Ask your fellow coworkers
    - Discuss your work, best practices, or get advice and resources
- Answer other coworkers' questions!

We host 
[Social Coworking + Office Hours](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) 
on the first Tuesday of each month, alternating among timezones to 
accommodate different parts of the world.
