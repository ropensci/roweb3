A new post of our interview series [“Meeting the stars of the R-universe”](/tags/r-universe-stars/). We aim to introduce the teams and people behind the development of software and packages many of us use and which are available through the R-universe. We want to highlight and explore different teams and projects around the world, the work they do, their processes and users. Our third stop is __Norway__ to talk with __Athanasia Monika Mowinckel__.

Working with the human brain requires specific software and complex developments. However R appears as the natural way to collect hundreds of data that need to be analyzed and the R-Universe as the most friendly place to share and invite to collaborate.

Athanasia Monika Mowinckel introduces herself simply as Mo, which is her nickname. But her CV is much more extensive and includes, amog many other activities, her current work at the [Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition](https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/research/groups/lcbc/index.html) at the University of Oslo in Norway. She works there as a scientist and tell us that her work _"involves research software engineering or research data management"_ and because of that _"R is the default statistical program we use for our daily work at the center, and we generate results in the form of R packages."_

In her work, they use specialized software because of the information they need to process, such as brain images. Athanasia explains that _"at the end of the day all their statistics are in R, and because of that having our R packages in our tool belt when we are working is super important for our staff."_

Athanasia is working on a project called [Life Brain](https://www.lifebrain.uio.no/), funded by the European Union for the Human Life brand and involving 13 European centers. Mo explains that they have developed a lot of research and made publications, and many results have been implemented in R packages. Asked about the project, with passion and great enthusiasm, Mo says: 

> We are trying to investigate how people are aging, what their brain aging is like, what their cognitive aging is like.

## R-Universe

> The R universe actually came at an extremely timely point for us, 

is how Athanasia explains the possibilities this platform offered them to [show in a simple way all the software they were working on](https://lifebrain.r-universe.dev/). In this research development, there are different types and sources of funding. Even though they have a collective organization in GitHub, they needed a clear way to show all the work that is distributed in different repositories in the personal accounts of the researchers or the accounts of the research centers. That is why Mo assures that in R-Universe 

> we can create a place for all our universe and thus show the packages.

In addition, as Athanasia explains, in R-Universe it is very clear who the developers or maintainers are and that means that everyone keeps their corresponding credits and contributions.


Another interesting use of R-Universe to share work, and Mo showed us is the possibility of accessing the data but also some extra functions, the same functions they used in their analysis. For example, those in the survey they conducted globally on brain health where obtained more than 27 thousand responses and from which they produced different articles and papers (you can see more information about this work in the video below).

While we go through all the packages in the R Universe by Athanasia and Life Brain's work, she shows us her greatest pride: [ggseg](https://ggseg.r-universe.dev/), a development to create images of the brain that can be analyzed from different functions. It was precisely with all this work that Mo found in R-Universe the solution to a  series of problems with the size of the data and the installation of the tools needed to work: 

> When the data packages are too big and cannot be reduced, it is not possible to publish them in CRAN (...) and failures appear when users want to install them in their development version that took us a long time to solve and with non-optimal results.

In this context is when R Universe presents her with a definitive solution: 

> This is the real solution to be able to have everything we work on the project with a working installation and not waste any more time troubleshooting our users.

In Athanasia's experience, R-Universe allowed them to publish all the packages in one place, with easy accessibility and the possibility to receive contributions, maintenance and no installation problems for the users. In her own words: 

> R-Universe is magic for me.

Remember that R-Universe generates binaries for different operating systems for all packages that belong to the universe, with no limit on the package size. One of the platform’s objectives is to make it easier to publish and install R packages.

In the following video, Athanasia explains in more detail the development of their Life Brain project, how they use R to organize and work with information, and how R-Universe allowed them to organize and share all their packages.
