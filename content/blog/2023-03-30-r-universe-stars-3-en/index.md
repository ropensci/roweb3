A new post of our interview series [“Meeting the stars of the R-universe”](/tags/r-universe-stars/). We aim to introduce the working groups and people behind the development of software and packages many of us use and which are available through the R-universe. We want to highlight and explore different teams and projects around the world, the work they do, their processes and users. 

Our third stop is Norway with Athanasia Monika,
