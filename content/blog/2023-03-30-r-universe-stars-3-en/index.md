A new post of our interview series [“Meeting the stars of the R-universe”](/tags/r-universe-stars/). We aim to introduce the working groups and people behind the development of software and packages many of us use and which are available through the R-universe. We want to highlight and explore different teams and projects around the world, the work they do, their processes and users. Our third stop is __Norway__ to talk with __Athanasia Monika Mowinckel__.


Working with the human brain requires specific software and complex developments, however R appears as the natural way to collect hundreds of data that need to be analyzed and the R Universe as the most friendly place to share and invite to collaborate.

Athanasia Monika Mowinckel introduces herself simply as Mo, which is her nickname, but her CV is much more extensive and includes her actual work at the center for lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition at the University of Oslo in Norway. There she works as a scientist and tell us that her work “involve research software engineering or research data management” and because of that “R is like more or less the default statistical program we use for our day to day work at the center, at least for like tabular data”.

In their work they use specialized software because of the type of information they need to process, for example, brain images. However, Athanasia explains that "at the end of the day all their statistics are in R and because of that “having our packages in our tool belt when we're working is super important for our staff”.

Athanasia is currently working on a project called Life Brain, funded by the European Union for the Human Life brand and involving 13 European centers. Mo explains that they have developed a lot of research and made publications and many of the results have been expressed in the R packages. Asked about the project, with passion and great enthusiasm, Mo says: "We are trying to investigate how people are aging, what their brain aging is like, what their cognitive aging is like".

The R Universe

“The R universe actually came at an extremely timely point for us”, this is how Athanasia explains the possibility that this tool offered them to show in a simple way all the material they were working on. This is explained because in the development of the research they carry out there are different types and sources of funding.  Even though they have a collective organization in GitHub they needed a clear way to show all the work that is distributed in different repositories in the personal accounts of the researchers or in the accounts of the organizations. That is why Mo assures that in R Universe "we can create a place for all our universe and thus show the packages".

In addition, as Athanasia explains in R-Universe it is very clear who the developers or maintainers are and that means that everyone keeps their corresponding credits and contributions. 
One of the interesting points of the shared work in R-Universe that Mo showed us is the possibility of accessing the data but also some extra functions that are the same that they used in the analysis. For example those found in the survey they conducted globally on brain health where they obtained more than 27 thousand responses and from which they produced different articles and papers (You can see more information about this work in the video bellow).  

While we go through all the packages contained in the R Universe of Athanasia and Life Brain's work, he shows us his greatest pride: ggseg, a development to create images of the brain that can be analyzed from different functions. It was precisely with all this work that Mo found in R Universe the solution to a  series of problems with the size of the data and the installation of the tools needed to work: "When the data packages are too big and cannot be reduced, it is not possible to publish them in CRAN (...) and failures appear when users want to install them in their development version that took us a long time to solve and with non-optimal results".

In this context is when R Universe presents her with a definitive solution: "This is the real solution to be able to have everything we work on the project with a working installation and not waste any more time troubleshooting our users".

In Athanasia's experience R Universe allowed him to publish all the packages in one place, with easy accessibility and the possibility to receive contributions, maintenance and no installation problems for the users. 
In her own words: "R-Universe is magic for me".

Remember that the R Universe generates the installers of all the packages that belong to the universe, for different operating systems and there are no limits on the size of the package. One of the objectives of the platform is to make it easier to publish and discover R packages.

In the following video, Athanasia explains in more detail the development of their Life Brain project, the way they use R to organize and work with information and shows us how R Universe allowed them to organize and share all their packages.
