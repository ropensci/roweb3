Can you think of an rOpenSci community member that you'd like to thank?

- A reviewer who helped you improve your package?
- Someone who answered your question? 
- A community call speaker from whom you gained insight?
- Someone who encouraged you behind the scenes?

Consider leaving them a note in the comments below expressing your gratitude. 
We often *think* our thank yous, but *expressing* thank yous can be incredibly meaningful.
Try to be specific. 
What did they do? 
What impact did their actions have?

On that note, we also want to take a moment to say **thank you**, to YOU.
Thank you so much for making the rOpenSci community that much more awesome.

Although it's been another hard year across the globe, this community has continued to come together to build good things.
We've had 20 packages successfully complete [software peer review](/software-review/)[^1] with the help of about 40 [reviewers](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html#reviewers) and 11 [editors](/about/#team), including 3 [new editors](/blog/2021/10/12/editors2021/). 
Many people contributed code or documentation. Similar to last year, 85 people made their first code contribution to rOpenSci this year! 
Others shared 88 new [use cases](/usecases/) to help package authors see how their work is being used and help other users imagine how they can apply it.

Our community has benefited from the voices of many different people this year. Our [blog](/archive/) had 34 community member authors, including 13 first-time authors, [Community Calls](/commcalls/) were attended by over 200 people in 27 countries on 5 continents, and virtual [social coworking and office hours](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/) brought together people from at least 12 countries to get their own work done and to join in some spirited scavenger hunts!
Many others have continued to cite our software, ask or answer questions, open issues to report bugs or request features, make pull requests to fix things, weigh in on standards and best practices, invited us to talk about our work, or mentioned us in a presentation, a post, or on Twitter.
