description: "Introducing Champions and Mentors - Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji and Christina Maimone"

*We designed the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) with a mentorship aspect. Mentoring plays a significant role in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees alike. In our program, each Champion has a mentor who accompanies them during their training and development of their project.*

*In this series of blog posts, we introduce you to the ten teams of this first cohort and what they will be working on in the program.*

Meet **Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji** from Nigeria and **Christina Maimone** from United States!
