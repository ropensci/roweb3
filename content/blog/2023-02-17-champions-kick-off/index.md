## The Champions Program got off to a great start in 2023!

From September to November 2022, we [launched the rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/).

We received a total of **102** applications from **31** different countries. Seventy-four applications were for champions and twenty eight for mentors. We are very grateful to everyone who took the time to apply to our program.

Champions could select one of three project options: **51%** chose to **develop a new package**, **25%** to be part of our **review process**, and **24%** to **submit a package to our peer review** process.

{{< figure src="countriesApplications.png" alt="Map of the world with the countries colored according to the number of applications. Applications are shown in America, Europe, Oceania, Asia and Africa (in that order with respect to the number of applications)." >}}

After carefully reviewing each application, we selected [ten champions and ten mentors](/champions/) for this first cohort.  **Three** of our champions will **develop a new package**, **four** will **prepare and submit their package to the review process**, and **three** will **become rOpenSci reviewers**.

The mentors will accompany their mentees throughout the process of executing their projects.

These first participants are from **Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Nigeria, Turkey, Australia, France, Norway, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and the United Kingdom**.

## Kick-off meetings

As scheduled, during January, we held the kick-off meetings for the program. Due to time zone differences, we have at least two versions of all planned activities.

During these meetings, mentors and champions introduced themselves and shared where they are from, what your project is about, and something that excites them about the program.   We also went over the logistics of the program, the potential agenda, and scheduled activities.  In these meetings, we noticed the participants' enthusiasm to learn, share, execute their projects, and give back to the community.

## Training

During February and March, champions and mentors will receive training in different topics that will provide them with useful tools to carry out their projects.

In April and May, we will conduct workshops for those not selected to be champions. These workshops will teach tools for open-source software development.  We hope that this offer can serve to gain skills for their tasks as research software developers and help them with future applications to this or other similar programs.  We will be publishing details about these workshops in March.

Stay tuned for more information about our mentors, champions, and their projects!
