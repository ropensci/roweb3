description: "Introducing Champions and Mentors - Ghozayel Elotteebi and Zebulun Arendsee"
---

*We designed the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) with a mentorship aspect. Mentoring plays a significant role in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees alike. In our program, each Champion has a mentor who accompanies them during their training and development of their project.*

*In this series of blog posts, we introduce you to the ten teams of this first cohort and what they will be working on in the program.*

And last, but not least, meet **Ghozayel Elotteebi** from Saudi Arabia and **Zebulun Arendsee** from United States!


## Ghozayel Elotteebi - Champion

Hi, I'm Ghozayel Elotteebi, an [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)](https://osc-ksa.com/) member with an MA in applied linguistics. I'm based in the UK, completing my PhD at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/). 

I've developed a new package called [Lextale](https://ghozayel.github.io/Lextale/). To my knowledge, this is the first R package in the field of linguistics developed in Saudi Arabia and would be the first local contribution to rOpenSci. I would love to create a community of contributors around the packages and promote advocacy for a culture of data sharing and reusable software, especially from Middle East/North Africa regions. Being part of rOpenSci is an opportunity for networking with other champions/mentors from around the world, a potential to support the community, share experiences, and contribute to the existing body of reproducible science.

## Zebulun Arendsee - Mentor

Hi! I'm Zebulun Arendsee (Zeb) and hope to serve as a mentor in R package development. 

I am a bioinformatics scientist at Regeneron working on sequencing, annotation, and oligonucleotide therapeutics design. In the past, I studied influenza at the USDA as a postdoc and orphan genes at Iowa State University as a graduate student. I've published many packages in R, including a few on CRAN and rOpenSci. I also develop in Python where I maintain several packages on PyPI and Conda and have one accepted JOSS paper. Outside my scientific work, I write mostly in Haskell, where I am building the Morloc programming language. 

So that's me in a nutshell, I'm really excited about the Champion Program and am looking forward to helping where I can!


_We're excited to have both Ghozayel and Zebulun be part of the Champions program and look forward to enjoying the outcomes of their project._

_This is the last introduction and we hope you've enjoyed meeting our 2022/2023 Champions and Mentors!_
