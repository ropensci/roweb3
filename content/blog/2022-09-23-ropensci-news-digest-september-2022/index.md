<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/09/23/ropensci-news-digest-september-2022).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Check out our Calls for new maintainers!

A few packages are [looking for new maintainers](#call-for-maintainers).
Do you want to maintain software that will help fellow R users extract tables out of PDFs, or access data from the IUCN Red list of endangered species, or perhaps something else completely?
See if one of these packages appeals to you!
You could volunteer on your own or as a team of maintainers (the more the merrier!).
The rOpenSci team will be happy to help you with specifics, and will provide resources, tips and PR reviews as needed.
Thank you!

### Coworking sessions continue!

Join us for social coworking & office hours monthly on first Tuesdays! 
Hosted by Steffi LaZerte and various community hosts. 
Everyone welcome. 
No RSVP needed. 
Consult our [Events](/events) page to find your local time and how to join.

* [Tuesday, 04 October 2022 9 AM Australian Western / 1:00 UTC ](/events/coworking-2022-10/) "Start writing that package!" *Hosted by community host [Nick Tierney](/author/nicholas-tierney/) and [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/)*
    * Cowork on a project of your choice;
    * Take time to look up how to write a package;
    * Start putting together that package you've always meant to;
    * Or talk to [Nick Tierney](/author/nicholas-tierney/) and others about how to get started.

Find out about more [events](/events).

### pkgcheck updates

Our [pkgcheck checks](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck) now have an additional category beyond just pass (:heavy_check_mark:) or fail (:heavy_multiplication_x:). Some checks indicate aspects which are worth considering, but which might not necessarily be considered check failures. We have introduced the symbol :eyes: to denote aspects of packages which authors might consider modifying or tweaking at their discretion, but which do not indicate failing checks. The only check in this category at present is the check for duplicated function names, but other :eyes: checks are likely to be included as our automated check system expands its scope in the future.

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following  package recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [canaper](https://docs.ropensci.org/canaper), developed by Joel H. Nitta: Provides functions to conduct categorical analysis of neo- and paleo-endemism (CANAPE).

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Improve your code with lintr's new linters!

The most recent lintr release includes [a bunch of new linters originally authored by Google developers](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/07/lintr-3-0-0/#google-linters). 
Have a look at the list, and run it on one of your codebases!
Thanks to [Hugo Gruson](https://github.com/Bisaloo) for this tip.

To run _all_ linters there are you could run [`lintr::lint_package(linters = lintr::linters_with_tags(tags = NULL))`](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/issues/1482#issuecomment-1198590483) (or first filter a bit the list returned by `lintr::linters_with_tags(tags = NULL)` in case you see too many [false positives](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Afalse-positive) for one of the linters).

### Minimum R version dependency in R packages

Curious about why and how to make your R package depend on a minimal R version?
See this [R-hub blog post by Hugo Gruson and Ma√´lle Salmon](https://blog.r-hub.io/2022/09/12/r-dependency/).

### Tweak the commit message obtained by merging a GitHub pull request

You might be interested in [New options for controlling the default commit message when merging a pull request](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-new-options-for-controlling-the-default-commit-message-when-merging-a-pull-request/) to make the merge/squash commit messages more informative.
