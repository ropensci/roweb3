A new R package, [cffr](https://docs.ropensci.org/cffr/), has been
[developed](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr),
[peer-reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/463) by
rOpenSci and accepted by [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cffr). This
package has a single purpose: to create a valid CITATION.cff file using the
metadata of any R package.

## CITATION.cff files and why they matter

A [Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) is a
plain text file with human- and machine-readable citation information for
software (and datasets)[^1].

[^1]: Druskat, S., Spaaks, J. H., Chue Hong, N., Haines, R., Baker, J., Bliven,
    S., Willighagen, E., Pérez-Suárez, D., & Konovalov, A. (2021). Citation File
    Format (Version 1.2.0) \[Computer software\].
    <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171937>

Under the hood, a CFF file is a YAML file. YAML has the advantage of being
easily understood by any user, and can also be easily converted to another data
serialization language, such as JSON or XML. This is an example of the minimal
content of a valid CITATION.cff file:

``` yaml
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: 'To cite package "cffr" in publications use:'
title: 'cffr: Generate Citation File Format (''cff'') Metadata for R Packages'
authors:
- family-names: Hernangómez
  given-names: Diego
```

In this example, the identification of the software and the author is quite
straightforward, as it is provided by the fields `title` and `authors`. The
information that can be included on a CFF file can be further enriched with
additional fields (like `version`, `year` or `doi`), as the [Citation File
Format schema version
1.2.0](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md#valid-keys)
accepts [21 different keys](#valid-keys).

### Why do CFF files matter?

Citing a book, an article, or a thesis is not difficult. The title, authors and
publication date are easily identifiable in most of the cases. However, software
is rarely cited on research projects. One of the reasons is "*the lack of a
clear citation information from package developers"*, as already mentioned in a
previous post ([Make Your R Package Easier to
Cite](/blog/2021/02/16/package-citation/)). Developers spend thousand of hours
on developing new and exciting software or adding new features to existing ones,
so citing software is a matter of giving credit where credit is due. For more
reasons why it is important to cite R software see [Steffi
LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/)'s blog post [How to Cite R and R
Packages](/blog/2021/11/16/how-to-cite-r-and-r-packages/).

In July 2021, GitHub announced a [built-in citation
feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)
that enables any software user to cite any repository in
[APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/journal-article-references#1)
or [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/Using/) style.

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< tweet user="natfriedman" id="1420122675813441540" >}}
<!--/html_preserve-->

This built-in feature heavily relies on the CFF format, rendering the
information of the CITATION.cff file into the aforementioned styles.

This announcement was, in my very personal opinion, a game-changer for the
software citation ecosystem. As a proof of that, on the two following days
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) announced
support for CITATION.cff files in their GitHub integration:

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< tweet user="zenodo_org" id="1420357001490706442" >}}
{{< tweet user="zotero" id="1420515377390530560" >}}
<!--/html_preserve-->

Integration with Zenodo means that when creating a Digital Object Identifier
([DOI](https://www.doi.org/)) for a GitHub repository via Zenodo, the DOI would
be generated according to the metadata included in the CITATION.cff file of the
repository. This feature saves developers the extra effort of making both DOI
and software consistent in terms of metadata. See an example of the [DOI of
cffr](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5646626), whose title, description and
author has been gathered from the [cffr CITATION.cff
file](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr/blob/main/CITATION.cff).

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< imgtxt src = "zotero.png" width ="188" alt = "Screenshot of Zotero importing citation information for GitHub repo">}}
<!--/html_preserve-->

In the case of Zotero (reference management software), the information in the
CITATION.cff file of any repository is detected when adding that repository to a
library from a url.

This handy feature means that a GitHub repository can effectively behave as a
DOI, ISBN or arXiv ID. Zotero will recognize the author, title, date and other
relevant metadata of the repository, including it in the personal Zotero
reference library of the user.

And there is still more! [CiteAs](https://citeas.org/) service also supports CFF
files[^2], and in the future more platforms such as
[JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7945) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337368)[^3] may add
support to CITATION.cff files, (and why not [CRAN or
BioConductor](https://twitter.com/egonwillighagen/status/1456322595096170503)?).

### Other software citation projects

The [CodeMeta Project](https://codemeta.github.io/)[^4] creates a concept
vocabulary that can be used to standardize the exchange of software metadata
across repositories and organizations. One of the many uses of a codemeta.json
file is to provide citation metadata such as title, authors, publication year or
version. The [codemetar](https://docs.ropensci.org/codemetar/) package[^5]
allows you to generate codemeta.json files from R package metadata.

## Using cffr

Getting started with cffr is pretty easy. There is a main function (likely the
only one you would need for an in-development package) named
[`cff_write()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/cffr/reference/cff_write.html) that
extracts the metadata of your package (already included in your DESCRIPTION and
inst/CITATION files), converts it into a CITATION.cff file and validates it
against the latest [CFF validation
schema](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema.json)
using [jsonvalidate](https://docs.ropensci.org/jsonvalidate/)[^6]:

[^6]: Rich FitzJohn, Rob Ashton, Mathias Buus and Evgeny Poberezkin (2021).
    jsonvalidate: Validate 'JSON' Schema. *R package version 1.3.2*.
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=jsonvalidate>

``` r
library(cffr)
 
# For in-development packages
cff_write()
```

    #> 
    #> CITATION.cff generated
    #>
    #> cff_validate results-----
    #> Congratulations! This .cff file is valid

### Working with `cff` objects

It is also possible to create a `cff` object (a regular R list with a custom
printing method) for any package installed locally on your machine. In the next
example I create a `cff` object for the
[rtweet](https://docs.ropensci.org/jsonvalidate/)[^7] package:

[^7]: Kearney, M. (2019, October 24). rtweet: Collecting and analyzing Twitter
    data. *Journal of Open Source Software*. The Open Journal.
    <http://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01829>

```{r cffr-rtweet-example}

library(cffr)

cff_rtweet <- cff_create("rtweet")

cff_rtweet

```

Note the special field,
[`preferred-citation`](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md#preferred-citation),
that would be used to generate the citation information on GitHub. If this field
is not present, GitHub would reuse other keys in the file to auto-generate a
citation reference.

As already mentioned, cffr uses information from the DESCRIPTION (via the
[desc](https://github.com/r-lib/desc)[^8] package) and the inst/CITATION file to
extract the metadata. I will focus now on comparing the citation info from
rtweet and the information generated by cffr:

[^8]: Gábor Csárdi, Kirill Müller and Jim Hester (2021). desc: Manipulate
    DESCRIPTION Files. *R package version 1.4.0*.
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=desc>

```{r cffr-compare-cit}

toBibtex(citation("rtweet"))

cff_rtweet$`preferred-citation`
```

We can check that the core information of the rtweet citation has been included
in the `cff` object, and we can also check fields included in the DESCRIPTION
file of rtweet:

```{r cff-desc}

packageDescription("rtweet",
  fields = c(
    "Title", "Description", "Author", "Version", "URL"
  )
)
```

In the next chunk I compare it with the corresponding fields from the `cff`
object:

```{r cff-desc-compare}
as.cff(cff_rtweet[
  c("title", "abstract", "authors", "version", "url")
])
```

### Valid keys {#valid-keys}

Here is a list of all the valid keys of the CFF schema. Most of them have an
explicit mapping with the fields (or a combination of fields) in the DESCRIPTION
and inst/CITATION files:

```{r cff-keys, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

knitr::kable(matrix(cff_schema_keys(sorted = TRUE), ncol = 3),
  col.names = NULL
)
```

The cffr package also includes an extensive
[vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/cffr/articles/crosswalk.html) describing
how these fields are computed with several examples.

### Validating a `cff` object

Once we have created an `cff` object, we can check its validity using the
`cff_validate()` function. This function can be used with `cff` objects and with
CITATION.cff files. If there are any errors, output messages will help us debug
our object:

```{r validating}

cff_validate(cff_rtweet)

# Creating a CITATION.cff file from an cff object and validating it
cff_rtweet %>%
  # Write it to a tempfile
  cff_write(tempfile("CITATION", fileext = ".cff"),
    verbose = FALSE,
    validate = FALSE
  ) %>%
  cff_validate()

# Create a deliberated error and use the validator
# Override the defaults with keys param

wrong_keys <- list(
  url = "I am not an url",
  doi = "I am not a doi"
)

cff_create("rtweet", keys = wrong_keys) %>%
  cff_validate()

```

Validation of the initial `cff` object is satisfactory, as seen in the messages.
But in the second example, where I forced some invalid values using the `keys`
parameter, we can see that the `doi` and `url` field are flagged as errors, as
the text strings do not correspond with the expected patterns for those fields
(e.g "http\*" for urls and "10XXXX/XXXX" for DOIs).

### Keeping your CITATION.cff file up-to-date

A CITATION.cff includes relevant information about the version, the release date
and the DOI of your package, so you would want to keep this information
up-to-date. cffr includes a [GitHub
Action](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-citation-cff.yaml)
that does the work for you.

It can be installed in your repo with the
[`cff_gha_update()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/cffr/reference/cff_gha_update.html)
or copied to your `.github/workflows` folder, and it would update your
CITATION.cff file on the following events:

-   When you publish a new release of the package on your GitHub repo.

-   Each time that you modify your DESCRIPTION or inst/CITATION files.

-   Additionally, the action can be run also manually.

This will ensure that the citation of your package is always accurate.

## Conclusion

Over the last few months, support of CITATION.cff files has increasingly grown
in the scientific citation ecosystem. The cffr package allows any R-package
developer to easily integrate citation information with a wide variety of
services via the creation of a CITATION.cff file leveraging the support
introduced by GitHub.
