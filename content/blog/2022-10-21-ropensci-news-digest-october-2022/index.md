## Software :package:

### New packages




The following  package recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [aorsf](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf), developed by Byron Jaeger: Fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random survival forests. Oblique decision trees are notoriously slow compared to their axis based counterparts, but aorsf runs as fast or faster than axis-based decision tree algorithms for right-censored time-to-event outcomes. Methods to accelerate and interpret the oblique random survival forest are described in Jaeger et al., (2022) <arXiv:2208.01129>.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=aorsf). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/532/) by Christopher Jackson, Marvin Wright, and Lukas Burk.
