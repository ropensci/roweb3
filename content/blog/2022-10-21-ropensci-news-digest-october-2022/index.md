Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/10/21/ropensci-news-digest-october-2022).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### rOpenSci Champions Program: call for Champions and call for Mentors

The [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities. 
That is why this program focuses on __people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded__ from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and research software communities.

#### Call for Champions

If you are selected as a Champion, over the course of a year you will develop a project, get training, and be mentored. You will also receive a small stipend. 

You can apply until **November 7, 2022** with this [form](/champions/#how-to-apply).  You can read more details in this [blog post](/blog/2022/09/22/launch-champions-program/).

#### Call for Mentors

### Better search on R-universe

<!-- to be curated manually -->

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Are you ready to develop packages?

If the question applies to _you_ as an R user, know that in [Susan Johnston’s wise words](https://github.com/susjoh/fibonacci), if you can open R, if you can install a package, if you can write functions or learn how to write functions, you can write an R package! If you're still not sure please refer to the resources listed in our [dev guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#learning-about-package-development).

On the other hand, if this question applies to _your machine_, you might use the following functions to find out:

* [`devtools::dev_sitrep()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/dev_sitrep.html);
* [`devtools::has_devel()`](https://r-lib.github.io/pkgbuild/reference/has_compiler.html);
* [`usethis::git_sitrep()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/git_sitrep.html).

These functions can also be run at any point during your package development work, even once you're used to such work, as they might help you understand why something "weird" is happening.

### How to run code during package installation?

If for any reason you ever need to run code during the installation of your package, know that it is possible as [noted by Gábor Csárdi on RStudio community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/t/is-it-possible-to-run-a-command-during-package-install/147192/4).
The example given, from [purrr](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/blob/f67f77134cd258fced27834595c4091f49be62e1/configure), consists in adding a [note before examples for older versions of R](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/blob/f67f77134cd258fced27834595c4091f49be62e1/inst/tools/examples.R).

Now if your goal is to install an external software, as noted in the forum answer it might be better to provide a function for the users to install the software.
Then you could also provide a sitrep function for checking the installation, like the sitrep functions mentioned in the previous tip!

### Optional (Suggests) dependency that has been archived on CRAN

An interesting challenge reported on [rOpenSci forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/optional-suggests-dependency-that-has-been-archived-on-cran/3071): can a package on CRAN depend on a package that has been archived on CRAN?
[Jeffrey Hanson](https://jeffrey-hanson.com/) wrote, after successfully updating the [prioritizr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prioritizr/index.html) package on CRAN despite its (Suggests) depending on [cplexAPI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cplexAPI/index.html),

> Just to follow up in case this helps anyone else, it would appear that it’s fine to have archived packages listed as Suggests for CRAN submission - as long as conditions for non-CRAN packages are met (e.g., listing URL for package install in the DESCRIPTION file).

Thanks to [Lluís Revilla Sancho](https://llrs.dev/) for his insights [in that same thread](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/optional-suggests-dependency-that-has-been-archived-on-cran/3071/3).
