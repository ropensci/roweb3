We designed the rOpenSci champions program with a mentorship aspect. Mentoring plays a significant role in the growth and development of mentors and mentees. In our program, each champion has a mentor who accompanies them during their training and development of their project.

In this series of blog posts, we introduce you to the ten teams of this first cohort and what they will be working on in the program.

Meet **Paola Corrales** from Argentina and **Adam Spark** from Australia.


## Pao Corrales - Champion

Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Buenos Aires. I study Atmospheric Sciences applying data assimilation techniques to improve short-term forecasts of severe events in Argentina. I love R and teaching science and programming using evidence-based practices centered on the students and their context. 

As a Champion, I would like to submit the [{agromet} R package](https://github.com/AgRoMeteorologiaINTA/agromet) to the peer review process and gain more experience as a developer. I hope that this package, thoroughly documented in Spanish, for agrometeorological applications can be improved and used by many people. 

I'm also looking forward to sharing experiences between champions and learning from everyone during this process.

## Adam Sparks - Mentor

{{< figure src = "/img/team/adam-sparks.jpg" class = "pull-left" width = "300" alt = "Profile photo of Adam Sparks" caption = "<center><strong>Adam Sparks</strong></center>">}}
Adam leads a research group for the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development in Western Australia, Australia that conducts research in the areas of agricultural systems modelling and climate change, maintains a weather station network and provides biometry (statistical) support for the department. 

He is a co-founder of [Open Plant Pathology](https://openplantpathology.org/), and is currently serving as an editor for rOpenSci. He has authored or co-authored more than seven R packages for CRAN and maintains one registered Julia package. 

Adam was born in Indiana, USA and earned his undergraduate degree in agronomy from Purdue University, a graduate certificate in geographic information science and his PhD in plant pathology on the epidemiology and ecology of plant pathogens from Kansas State University in the USA. After immigrating to Australia, he is now usually found in Perth, WA, Australia these days.
