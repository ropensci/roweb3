preface: |
  One of the best things about open software is that it can be a community project with contributions from people other than just the maintainer.
  Sometimes those contributions are opportunistic, and sometimes maintainers solicit specific contributions, and that’s the case here!

The package [assertr](https://docs.ropensci.org/assertr) maintained by [Tony Fischetti](/author/tony-fischetti/), provides functionality to assert conditions that have to be met so that errors in data used in analysis pipelines can fail quickly. 
The provided functionality is similar to `stopifnot()` but more powerful, friendly, and easier for use in pipelines.
