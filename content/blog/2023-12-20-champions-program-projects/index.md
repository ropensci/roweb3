Our first cohort of the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) has now completed the second phase of the program by developing their project and carrying out outreach activities. In this article, we share each champions projects, their achievements and outreach activities.

## Champions' Projects

In their applications Champions choose to develop a new package or to participate in the review process as authors or reviewers.

### Project related to our Software Peer Review

-   **Carolina Pradier** from Argentina worked on the [eph](https://docs.ropensci.org/eph/) package, which facilitated the work with data from the Permanent Household Survey - INDEC, Argentina. Carolina added functionality to the package, reduced the number of dependencies, improved error messages and increased test coverage before submitting the package for review. After peer review in Spanish, her package is now part of the rOpenSci suite and was published in CRAN. Her mentor was [Athanasia Mo Mowinckel](/author/athanasia-mo-mowinckel/)

-   **Victor Ordu,** from Nigeria, worked on the [naijR ](https://docs.ropensci.org/naijR/)package, which contains a suite of functions that make it easier to deal with data and datasets about the country Nigeria and its constituent parts. Victor works on improving error messaging and replacing dependencies for spatial packages. After peer review, his package became part of the rOpenSci suite and was published in CRAN. His mentor was [Laura DeCicco](/author/laura-decicco/) from the US.  

-   **Alican Cagri Gokcek** from Turkey [reviewed Victor’s package](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/600). As a blind developer, Cagri add a focus on the accessibility of the visualization the package created in his review. His mentor was [Elio Campitelli](/author/elio-campitelli/) from Argentina. 

-   **Cesar Aybar** from Peru, developed the [rgeeExtra](https://r-earthengine.com/rgeeExtra/index.html) package that extends the functionality of {rgee}, a package to access Google Earth Engine API, to be able to access and process remote sensing spatial data with a friendly syntax for R users. Cesar worked on adding functionality, change the sintaxis of the package, improve test coverage and error messages, and replaced spatial dependencies that will be removed. His package is [under review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/608). His mentor was [Marc Choisy](/author/marc-choisy/) from Vietnam.

-   **Paola Corrales** from Argentina, developed the [agroclimatico package](https://github.com/AgRoMeteorologiaINTA/agroclimatico) that calculates climatic and hydrological indices and statistics from sorted data, including a function to plot geo-referenced results and cartographic information. Paola replaced dependencies, improved error messages, and increased test coverage. She had to make difficult decisions, such as changing the package’s name and some of the functions to avoid confusion with other existing packages. Agroclimatico is [under review in Spanish](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/599). Her mentor was [Adam Sparks](/author/adam-sparks/) from Australia.

-   **Marcos Prunello** from Argentina, worked on his package [karel](https://mpru.github.io/karel/), which implements Karel the robot in R, a useful tool to teach introductory concepts about programming in an interactive and fun way, by writing programs for Karel to complete tasks. In addition, the package provides functions, arguments, messages, and documentation in both English and Spanish, proposing an infrastructure that allows the addition of more languages. The package is in the process of review, being the first to have a **bilingual review**!


### Developing new packages

-   **Haydee Svab**, from Brazil, developed a new package called [odbr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/odbr/index.html) that allows accessing and processing data from the Brazilian origin and destination (od) surveys and implements many of the algorithms that Haydee developed for her master's thesis. The package was published in CRAN.

-   **Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji** from Nigeria, developed the new package [ChartkickR](https://github.com/BWOlatunji/chartkickR) is an htmlwidget that seamlessly integrates with the Chartkick JavaScript library. It provides R users with a straightforward interface to generate beautiful and interactive charts using R code. The package provides ten types of plots. [You can read more in Bilikisu's blog post](/blog/).

-   **Ghozayel Elotteebi** from Saudi Arabia, worked on a new package called [Lextale](https://ghozayel.github.io/Lextale/). To my knowledge, this is the first R package in the field of linguistics developed in Saudi Arabia and would be the first local contribution to rOpenSci.


### Outreach Activities

Our champions carried out a wide range of activities: talks, conference papers, workshops, blog articles, community calls and meetups. Let's review some of them.

## Acknowledgements

The rOpenSci Champions Program is funded by [The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/). This phase of the Champions Program was made possible by the work and feedback of many people.

We want to thank the [CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org/) team, especially *Lou Woodley*, *Camille Santistevan*, and *Maya Sanghvi*, for their support in designing the overall program and for their "Making a PACT" workshop for the Champions.

We also want to thank .
