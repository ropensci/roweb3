Dear rOpenSci community,

This is a bit of a bittersweet announcement... After nearly 13 years, it's time for me to step down as the Executive Director of rOpenSci.

In the summer of 2011 I co-founded rOpenSci alongside a group of dedicated colleagues. What began as a casual collaboration among open science enthusiasts quickly evolved into something far more meaningful. We never imagined it would become the global initiative it is today, with a team spanning the world and impacting countless researchers.

rOpenSci has become a major player in the open science and research software communities. We've built an ecosystem of tools that make research easier and bridge the gap between research and technology. We've been lucky to help many researchers not only with their research but also find fulfilling careers as software engineers. We initially focused our efforts on solving high-priority research needs, but this approach wasn't sustainable in the long run. Around 2014, we shifted to a collaborative model, working directly with researchers to combine their domain expertise with our software development skills. This shift led to the creation of our flagship software peer-review service.  It also inspired other successful initiatives like the [Open Journals](https://www.theoj.org/), [PyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/), and even influenced practices across various government agencies.

Our focus has grown over the years. We now offer a comprehensive software peer-review service, develop standards for statistical software packages, [maintain community infrastructure](https://r-lib.r-universe.dev/), and work to amplify underrepresented voices in the developer community. Our [unconferences](/tags/unconf/) have sparked innovation, nurtured new organizations, and cultivated leadership within our field.

The strength and resilience of our community are what truly make rOpenSci successful.  I'm confident knowing that Dr. Noam Ross, a valued member of our leadership team and lead of our software peer review, will be guiding the project as the acting director. His commitment and vision give me every confidence in a smooth transition and a vibrant future for rOpenSci.

I'm incredibly excited to see what the future holds for rOpenSci. There's so much potential for groundbreaking advancements and partnerships. I can't wait to see the continued impact of our collective efforts. I’ll continue to serve in an advisory capacity, supporting Noam and the team as they build new partnerships and guide rOpenSci’s future into its next chapter.

Thank you for your support, collaboration, and inspiration throughout these years. Here's to the next chapter of innovation and discovery in the rOpenSci community!
