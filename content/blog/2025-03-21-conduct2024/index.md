rOpenSci’s activities and spaces are supported by a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) 
that applies to all people participating in the rOpenSci community, 
including rOpenSci staff and leadership.
It applies to all modes of interaction including GitHub project repositories, 
the rOpenSci discussion forum, Slack, Community Calls, Co-working and social sessions, 
and in person at rOpenSci-hosted events, including affiliated social gatherings.
Our Code of Conduct is developed and enforced by a committee including rOpenSci staff and an independent community member.

Here we report our annual review of rOpenSci's Code of Conduct, 
reporting process, and internal guidelines for handling reports and enforcement.

## Updates

1.  No changes of Committee members for 2025.
    The committee members are [Natalia Morandeira](/author/natalia-morandeira/) (independent member), 
    [Mark Padgham](/author/mark-padgham) (rOpenSci Software Research Scientist) and 
    [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene) (rOpenSci Community Manager).
    We are responsible for receiving, investigating, adjudicating, enforcing, 
    and responding to all reports of potential violations of our Code.

2.  No changes have been made to the text of the Code in English or Spanish.

3.  The text of the Code of Conduct has been translated into Portuguese, thanks to [Beatriz Milz](/author/beatriz-milz/) and [Francesca Palmeira](/author/francesca-belem-lopes-palmeira/).
    The Portuguese version is available at [https://ropensci.org/pt/código-de-conduta/](/pt/código-de-conduta/).
  

Because the text has remained unchanged, the version number is kept at 2.5, dated January 30, 2024.

## Committee Members Activities

We reflected on how we handle incidents, make decisions, take necessary actions, and communicate both with reporters and/or reported persons. As a result of this reflection, we have been working on a [template to guide the CoC steps during an incident report]().

Yanina Bellini Saibene attended the Book Club organized by R-Ladies Global to 
read and discuss the book ["How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports"](https://files.frameshiftconsulting.com/books/cocguide.pdf). It was a good opportunity to discuss with and learn from 
other CoC member of other organizations including [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org), [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) and [Forwards](https://forwards.github.io). 

We welcome your feedback by [email](mailto:conduct@ropensci.org) to conduct at ropensci.org, 
and we thank you for continuing to work with us to ensure that rOpenSci remains a safe, 
enjoyable, friendly and enriching environment for everyone who participates.
