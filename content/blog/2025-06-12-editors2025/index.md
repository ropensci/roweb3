We are excited to welcome Emi Tanaka and Nima Hejazi to our team of [Associate Editors](/software-review/#editors) for rOpenSci [Stats Software Peer Review](/software-review/).
They join Laura DeCicco, Julia Gustavsen, Anna Krystalli, Mauro Lepore, Noam Ross, Maëlle Salmon, Emily Riederer, Adam Sparks, Beatriz Milz, Margaret Siple and Jeff Hollister.
Since 2015, rOpenSci has operated a thorough and collaborative software peer review system.
Our [editorial team](https://devguide.ropensci.org/editorguide.html) oversees the entire review process — conducting initial checks, selecting reviewers, and guiding the review until the package is approved for inclusion in rOpenSci’s [software suite](https://ropensci.org/packages/).
Given the wide range and number of packages we receive, having a team of editors with diverse and complementary expertise is essential.
Emi brings her experiences in , while Nima brings expertise in statistical causal inference, de-biased (or causal) machine learning, semi-parametric statistical methods, and computational statistics.

Meet our new editors!

Nima Hejazi obtained his PhD in Biostatistics from the University of California,
Berkeley and subsequently joined the faculty in the Department of Biostatistics
at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. His statistical science
research program focuses thematically on causal inference, causal/de-biased
machine learning, and semi-parametric methods, including the development of
open-source software packages--almost exclusively in R--to promote the use and
accessibility of state-of-the-art statistical methods (thus far, his software
contributions total some 15-odd R packages, many of which are available on CRAN
or Bioconductor). Nima strongly believes in the critical role of open-source
software tools in promoting reproducibility and transparency in the practice of
applied statistics and statistical data science.

I first heard of rOpenSci around 2017 at UC Berkeley, as my own interests in
statistical data science and open-source software for statistics were taking
shape (apparently, I've been following the rOpenSci blog since 2016). While I
was spending time on other projects at the time and working to find time to
contribute to other efforts, including Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry and
reviewing for the *Journal of Open Source Software* (JOSS), I followed this
project with interest, as it was well-aligned with open science initiatives
that are important to me. In beginning my independent faculty career a few
years ago, I began to notice a very limited set of opportunities for software
written for statistical science to be rigorously peer reviewed. Of course, the
rOpenSci community was ahead of me--this problem is exactly what the Stats
Software Peer Review system seeks to resolve. I was happy to receive the
invitation to join the team of associate editors and look forward to
contributing to the rOpenSci project!
