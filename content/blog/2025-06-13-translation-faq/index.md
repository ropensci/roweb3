In our [own words](/multilingual-publishing), publishing multilingual resources can lower the barrier to access to knowledge, help democratize access to quality resources and increase the possibilities of contributing to software and open science projects.
Our [multilingual publishing](/multilingual-publishing) ongoing efforts are crucial work for our [mission](/about).
When sharing about this project at [conferences](/talks-papers/) and [elsewhere](/commcalls/nov2023-multilingual/), we start an important conversation with people less used to such endeavours or to our particular [processes](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/).
In this post, we will summarize frequently asked questions, and our best answers to them (even better formulated than in the heat of a post-talk Q&A session :grin:).

## Will translations make people “lazy” in that they won’t learn English?

First of all, not learning English doesn’t mean being “lazy”. 
Working on one’s project with the tools at one’s disposal is already work enough. 
Besides, many people who do not speak English speak several languages.
Now, people might still choose to learn English later, for instance to take part in some conversations in English, but it won’t have been an issue for them to have first learnt how to, say, develop software using French.
Do we want people to learn how to use some tools or do we want them to be English speaking? 
In our case, we want people to be able to use and contribute to open-source tools without first having to become English speaking,
because we are aware of the "manifold costs of being a non-native English speaker in science"[^amano].

### Related: Is it that hard to read in English?

Yes, especially as it adds to the "manifold costs of being a non-native English speaker in science"[^amano] (we really like this paper :wink:).

## Why can’t we rely on automatic translation only?

Why can’t one publish automatic translations directly, or rely on tools for on-the-fly translations?
If you do that, the content in translated languages will be of a poorer quality so it’d mean accepting that users in some semi-supported language deserve less good translation.
This is a decision made at the organization level.

## Why don’t you use `<insert-name-of-translation-patform>` instead of Git and GitHub?

We are a technical community translating technical content. 
Git and GitHub fit well in our other development workflows. 
Many of our community members already know these tools and if they don’t we can help them learn them, knowledge they can then apply to other technical projects.
Read more about our tooling and processes in our [translation guide](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/intro.html#technical-infrastructure-and-workflows).

## Isn’t translation and the maintenance of translations a lot of work?

Yes it is! 
But we think it’s worth it.
Furthermore, translation work brings new contributors to the community, which a) helps share the load b) serves as a springboard towards other forms of contributions c) make our community more diverse.

## Conclusion

In this post we answered common questions we receive about our multilingual publishing project.
We are convinced providing quality multilingual resources is part of fostering more [diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility](/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/) in open source and open science.
We welcome your participation... and even further questions!
