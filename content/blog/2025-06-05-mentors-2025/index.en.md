We are excited to introduce the new team of mentors for the rOpenSci Champions Program! This year, we have ten very talented individuals, all from Latin America, who bring a unique combination of experience, enthusiasm, and commitment to open science. Some of them have already been part of the program in previous editions, either as mentors or Champions, and today, they return to continue strengthening this community.

Our new mentors come from a wide variety of disciplines and are active voices within the R community in the region, participating in different groups and initiatives. With their support, our new group of Champions will not only develop their projects but also grow as leaders in open science and research software development.

Hi, I'm Carolina Pradier and I will be participating as a mentor in this edition of rOpenSci Champions Program.

I am from Argentina, I have a degree in Economics from the University of Buenos Aires and I also have a Master's degree in Social Sciences of Work from the same university. I am currently living in Canada, where I am doing a PhD in Information Sciences. My doctoral thesis focuses on the study of inequalities in the scientific field in Latin America.

Within the rOpenSci community, I am a maintainer of the [eph package](https://docs.ropensci.org/eph/), a tool designed to facilitate the analysis of the Permanent Household Survey of Argentina. I participated as a student in a previous cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program, where my package [went through the rOpenSci peer review process.](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/593).

I am very excited to be part of the program as a mentor. I want to be able to pass on my experience in R package development to those who are taking their first steps in this community. But I also want to learn from other people, from their journeys, their motivations and their projects. I am convinced that opening spaces for exchange and mutual support is fundamental to continuing to build a diverse, inclusive and supportive community.

## Elina Gómez

{{< figure src = "/img/team/elina-gomez.png" width = "250" alt = "Profile picture of Elina Gómez" class = "pull-right" caption = "<strong>Elina Gómez </br> Universidad de la República </br> R-Ladies Montevideo - RUG Montevideo</strong>">}}

I am Elina Gómez Bonaglia, BA in Sociology, MA in Contemporary Latin American Studies and PhD candidate in Sociology at the Faculty of Social Sciences of Udelar, Uruguay.

I am a teacher and researcher at the Methods and Data Access Unit (UMAD) of the Faculty of Social Sciences (Udelar). I am dedicated to applied social research and its intersection with data science, specifically in the areas of public policy and massive text analysis. I have also been teaching basic and advanced R courses for more than ten years.

I am interested in participating in the Champions Program as a mentor and in following projects of different types, even in other research fields to which I am accustomed.

## Elio Campitelli

{{< figure src = "/img/team/elio-campitelli.jpg" width = "250" alt = "Profile picture of Elio Campitelli" class = "pull-left" caption = "<strong>Elio Campitelli </br> Monash University </br> rOpenSci - LatinR</strong>">}}

I am from Argentina but last year I moved to Australia because it is the only other country that starts with an 'A' and uses the same type of plug.

I am doing a postdoc at Monash University researching interactions between Antarctic sea ice and the atmosphere.

I was a mentor in a previous edition of the program. It was a great experience that I want to repeat.

## Francisco Cardozo

{{< figure src = "/img/team/francisco-cardozo.jpg" width = "250" alt = "Profile picture of Francisco Cardozo" class = "pull-right" caption = "<strong>Francisco Cardozo</br>Universidad de Miami </br> rOpenSci - The Carpentries</strong>">}}

My name is Francisco Cardozo. I am currently a doctoral student at the University of Miami, USA, where I am part of the Prevention Sciences and Community Health program.

I have worked in the evaluation of prevention programs in several Latin American countries. Currently, I am developing workshops to teach the use of software that improves the reproducibility and rigor of research. These workshops focus on the use of R and statistical analysis techniques, such as machine learning and latent variables.

I am deeply committed to strengthening technical capabilities within communities; I believe in equipping people with the tools they need to best execute their projects. I was a mentor in a previous cohort of the program and want to continue participating in this initiative.

## Geraldine Gómez Millán

{{< figure src = "/img/team/geraldine-gomez.png" width = "250" alt = "Profile picture of Geraldine Gómez Millán" class = "pull-left" caption = "<strong>Geraldine Gómez Millán</br>IBM</br>Epiverse TRACE-LAC</strong>">}}

My name is Geraldine Gómez Millán, I am from Colombia, I am a Systems Engineer and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Software Engineering. I have participated in several social projects, leading the development of packages and software in R with focus on epidemiology and regional analysis. I have done trainings in R and good programming practices.

I have experience in data analysis, software architecture, development methodologies, security, DevOps, Cloud and artificial intelligence. Currently, I lead an information security team and serve as a mentor in the Champions Program.

I firmly believe that knowledge that is not shared, does not exist. Sharing knowledge, building collectively and creating opportunities through learning and democratization of technology are key factors to transform society. I hope to contribute my experience and socio-technical knowledge from an ethical and innovative perspective, as well as to expand and learn about other ways of thinking and approaches to problem solving.

## Luis D. Verde Arregoitia
