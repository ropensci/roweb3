description: "Introducing Champions and Mentors - Haydee Svab and Beatriz Milz"
---

*We designed the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) with a mentorship aspect. Mentoring plays a significant role in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees alike. In our program, each Champion has a mentor who accompanies them during their training and development of their project.*

*In this series of blog posts, we introduce you to the ten teams of this first cohort and what they will be working on in the program.*

Meet **Haydee Svab** and **Beatriz Milz** both from Brazil!


## Haydee Svab - Champion

I'm Haydee Svab, graduated in civil engineering, master of science - speciality transport and planning engineering. For the last few years I've been working as a researcher and consultant in my own company, ASK-AR. Our main projects deal with data analysis, smart cities, urban mobility and gender perspective. I was born and have always lived in Brazil, more specifically in São Paulo, where I founded the local RLadies chapter together with other amazing women. 

Despite loving and  professionally working with the R language, I don't know how to make packages - and I always wanted to make one, with data and model derived from my master's dissertation. So, I saw in the Champion Program the opportunity to make that wish come true. 

Additionally, within the context of rOpenSci community, I recognize that the technical ability to create packages and its daily use can induce and facilitate the reuse and diffusion of codes from projects and initiatives that I am part of, be it R-Ladies or professional consultancy projects. Those will for sure benefit the R community, that will be able to leverage such packages.

Finally, I am super excited for the learning period we will have and to get to know better and contribute to the rOpenSci community.

My name is Beatriz Milz, and I am an R-Lady from São Paulo - Brazil. I am currently doing a Ph.D. in Environmental Science and also work as a Data Scientist and an R teacher at Curso-R. 

I am a tidyverse instructor certified by RStudio, and a co-organizer of communities and events, such as R-Ladies São Paulo, Latin-R, and satRday São Paulo. I also [have a blog](https://beamilz.com/) where I write about R: 

I will be a mentor in this edition of the Champions program, and I hope to help 
participants to create R packages and also review them for rOpenSci!

_We're excited to have both Haydee and Bea be part of the Champions program. We are very exited for the progress they have in the project. Stay-tuned for the next series of introductions._
