Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/10/22/ropensci-news-digest-october-2021).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Community call about the statistical software review project

A fantastic community call is coming up on Tuesday, 26 October 2021 18:00 UTC: [**Expanding Software Peer Review: Statistical Package Standards at rOpenSci**](/commcalls/oct2021-statsreview02/)!

This 1-hour community call will address the bigger picture of **how our community-informed development of standards for statistical packages meets a critical need of stakeholders**. 
[**Noam Ross**](/author/noam-ross/) (EcoHealth Alliance and rOpenSci Software Review Lead) will catch everyone up on the project. 
[**Rebecca Killick**](/author/rebecca-killick/) (Lancaster University and rOpenSci Statistical Software Peer Review advisory committee) will offer insights into standardisation and the potential role our program might play in the future of statistical software and open source software in general. 
[**Juliane Manitz**](/author/juliane-manitz/) (EMD Serono and R Validation Hub) will offer a perspective on the use of open source software in regulated environments. 
[**Christoph Sax**](/author/christoph-sax/) (cynkra) will share his experience as the first person to submit a package, tsbox, for review and aligning his software with our standards.

Follow the [community call page link](/commcalls/oct2021-statsreview02/) for practical information. 
**Everyone is welcome, no RSVP needed!**

### November 2 social coworking and office hours

Join us for [monthly coworking Tuesday, November 2nd at 16:00 UTC](/events/coworking-2021-11/)! No RSVP needed. In addition to the usual quiet and noisy rooms (for Q&A and meeting peers), [Mark Pagham](/author/mark-padgham/), co-Lead of our [Statistical Software Peer Review project](/stat-software-review/), will be there to help folks check their own package with our new automated checking system.

### rOpenSci at NHS-R conference

Jeroen Ooms, rOpenSci Lead Infrastructure Engineer, will give a talk on [The r-universe project](/r-universe/) at the [NHS-R 2021 virtual conference](https://nhsrcommunity.com/nhs-r-community-conference-2021/) on November 9. [Details](/events/nhsr-jeroen/).

Will Landau, community member, will give a workshop on Reproducible computation at scale in R with [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) on [November 4](https://nhsrcommunity.com/nhs-r-conference-2021-workshop-week/).

The conference is free with registration. [Conference website](https://nhsrcommunity.com/nhs-r-community-conference-2021/).

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following  package recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [rsat](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsat), developed by Unai Pérez - Goya together with Manuel Montesino - SanMartin, Ana F Militino, Maria Dolores Ugarte: Downloading, customizing, and processing time series of satellite images for a region of interest. rsat functions allow a unified access to multispectral images from Landsat, MODIS and Sentinel repositories. rsat also offers capabilities for customizing satellite images, such as tile mosaicking, image cropping and new variables computation. Finally, rsat covers the processing, including cloud masking, compositing and gap-filling/smoothing time series of images (Militino et al., 2018 <doi:10.3390/rs10030398> and Militino et al., 2019 <doi:10.1109/TGRS.2019.2904193>). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/437) by Marc Weber, Kelly Hondula.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Naming your package

Do you have a fantastic idea and plan for a package, but no name for it yet?
We have some tips on this topic in our [dev guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#naming-your-package)!

* We strongly recommend short, descriptive names in lower case. If your package deals with one or more commercial services, please make sure the name does not violate branding guidelines. You can check if your package name is available, informative and not offensive by using the [`available` package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/available). In particular, do _not_ choose a package name that's already used on CRAN or Bioconductor.

* A more unique package name might be easier to track (for you and us to assess package use) and search (for users to find it and to find answers to their questions). Obviously a _too_ unique package name might make the package less discoverable (e.g. it might be an argument for naming your package [geojson](https://github.com/ropensci/geojson)).
Also note that removing random letter e.g. vowels from a common word to create a package name might make it less easy to remember!

* Find other interesting aspects of naming your package [in this blog post by Nick Tierney](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2018/06/20/naming-things/), and in case you change your mind, find out [how to rename your package in this other blog post of Nick's](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2017/10/27/change-pkg-name/).

### Two testthat tips

The testthat package has been supporting [snapshot tests](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/10/testthat-3-0-0/#snapshot-testing) that "record expected output in a separate human-readable file instead of using code to describe what the expected output looks like." since its version 3.0.0.
Their implementation is now stable.
Note that they are skipped by default on CRAN.

Now what about _input files_ for tests? 
Maybe you can [create fake ones on the fly (and delete them)](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/11/18/testthat-utility-belt/#create-fake-folders-and-text-files-from-your-tests).
Or you can store them under `tests/testthat` and use [`testthat::test_path()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/test_path.html) when using them, to get a file path that "both interactively and during tests".
So to use `tests/testthat/examples/thing` you'd write `testthat::test_path("examples", "thing")`.
Note that the vcr package for HTTP testing has a similar function you can use to locate cassettes, [vcr_test_path()](https://docs.ropensci.org/vcr/reference/vcr_test_path.html).

### Passing CRAN URL checks

CRAN [checks URL validity](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/12/01/url-checks/).
As recently [reminded by Jenny Bryan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1450186196395520005), the [urlchecker package by Jim Hester](https://github.com/r-lib/urlchecker/) is a great tool to help your package pass these checks.

### Styling your package

How to enforce a style guide for your package, without too much human effort?
Two suggestions:

* Having a [GitHub Action workflow that allows you to call styler](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#commands-workflow) via typing `/style` in a PR comment (or amend the logic to have it work via applying a label to the PR). Or apply this idea to another continuous integration service! If for any reason your style differs from styler's default, follow one of [styler articles for developers](https://styler.r-lib.org/dev/articles/) and tweak the workflow. [Example](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck/blob/65fa9d4e77837bd122171d46177cb7db8028ac2e/.github/workflows/pr-commands.yaml#L60-L64), corresponding [style guide package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/spaceout).

* Using a service like [CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io) that integrates with GitHub directly. Thanks to [Rich FitzJohn](/author/rich-fitzjohn/) for suggesting this in [rOpenSci semi-open Slack workspace](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels).
