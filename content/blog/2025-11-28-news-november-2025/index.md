Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup! <!-- blabla --> You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2025/11/28/news-november-2025). Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### rOpenSci at LatinR

TODO YANI

### Big Team Collaboration on Data Management and Analysis with rOpenSci

[Liz Hare](/author/liz-hare) and [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/) gave a talk on Big Team Collaboration on Software Peer Review with rOpenSci at the Big Team Science Conference 2025. The slides and recording have been [posted](/events/BTSConf-2025)!

### rOpenSci at posit::conf(2025): recordings

Recordings from posit::conf(2025) are now [publicly available](https://posit.co/blog/talks-and-workshops-from-posit-conf-2025/) on YouTube! Many excellent talks to enjoy and learn from, including those from rOpensci community members.

-   [Mauro Lepore](/author/mauro-lepore) and [Eric Scott](/author/eric-scott) both presented lightning talks. Mauro talked about ["Approaching Positron from RStudio"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6PZ_RiZp44), Eric about ["Enabling geospatial workflow management with targets: an R package origin story"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmTtugX1CoE).

-   [Will Landau](/author/will-landau/) gave his talk ["R-multiverse: a next-generation R package repository system built on R-universe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UseltnRVoFo).

-   [Nic Crane](/author/nic-crane) presented on ["Hacking Productivity with LLMs: What Works (and What Doesn't)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nhDYt0f5yc).

-   [Noam Ross](/author/noam-ross/) and [Beatriz Milz](/author/beatriz-milz/) both presented in the session "It Takes a Village: Building and Sustaining Communities". Beatriz talked about ["Translating R for Data Science into Portuguese: A Community-Led Initiative"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBC8rNvh3Ns), Noam about ["rOpenSci Champions: Building Communities of Open-Source Leaders"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-atDblWsOBU).

-   [Luis D. Verde Arregoitia](https://ropensci.org/author/luis-d.-verde-arregoitia/) presented his talk ["Bold indicates negative?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJz0779Seto).

### Blog contributor roles in rOpenSci and beyond

We recently added support for contributor roles on our [blog](/blog/2025/10/14/blog-roles/): author, editor, translator, interviewee. Rogue Scholar, that generates the DOI of our posts (and many others'), also added this feature. Read more in their [announcement](https://blog.front-matter.de/posts/supporting-blog-contributions-beyond-authorship/). Thanks to Martin Fenner for supporting our efforts in recognizing all contributions to blog posts!

### Coworking

Read [all about coworking](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)!

-   Tuesday December 2nd, 14h00 Europe Central (13:00 UTC), ["Getting to know The Carpentries"](/events/coworking-2025-12/) with [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/) and cohost [Angelique Trusler](/author/angelique-trusler/).
    -   Visit [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/);  
    -   Meet community host, Angelique Trusler, and learn more about The Carpentries and how you might get involved.
-   Tuesday January 13th, 9:00 Americas Pacific (17:00 UTC), ["Let it go!"](/events/coworking-2026-01/) with [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/) and cohost [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/).
    -   Spend some time reviewing the forums, Slack workspaces, Newsletters, RSS feeds (etc. etc.) you're subscribed to;
    -   Unsubscribe to all you no longer need (Let it go!);
    -   Meet co-host, Yanina Bellini Saibene, and discuss strategies for this New Year decluttering of your digital (or perhaps not-so-digital) life. And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!

## Software :package:

### New packages

<div class="highlight">

</div>

The following package recently became a part of our software suite:

[Computo](https://computo-journal.org) is a journal promoting methodological, computational, and algorithmic contributions in statistics and machine learning that provide a better understanding of which models or methods are most appropriate to answer specific scientific questions. Computo leverages modern tools in programming and scientific reporting to support more transparent, interactive, and reproducible research outputs.

## Calls for contributions

### Calls for maintainers

If you're interested in maintaining any of the R packages below, you might enjoy reading our blog post [What Does It Mean to Maintain a Package?](/blog/2023/02/07/what-does-it-mean-to-maintain-a-package/).

[photosearcher](https://docs.ropensci.org/photosearcher), searches Flickr for photographs and metadata. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci/photosearcher/issues/22).

### Calls for contributions

Refer to our [help wanted page](/help-wanted/) -- before opening a PR, we recommend asking in the issue whether help is still needed.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

## Update of the vcr chapter in HTTP testing in R

We've updated the introduction to vcr in the [HTTP testing in R book](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/vcr.html), so that it reflects the current vcr version, in particular the `local_cassette()` function.

## pkgdown 2.2.0 makes it easier for LLMs to read your documentation

The latest pkgdown version adds a step to the website building, that creates:

-   a Markdown version of all HTML pages;
-   a standard file called `llms.txt` that compiles the content of the homepage and of the reference and article indices.

Read more about this, including how to opt-out (one config line) in the [release announcement](https://tidyverse.org/blog/2025/11/pkgdown-2-2-0/).

## testthat 3.3.0

If you use testthat, don't miss its [release announcement](https://tidyverse.org/blog/2025/11/testthat-3-3-0/)! Of note:

-   A new function `skip_unless_r()` to skip tests depending on the R version;
-   Tests using Suggested packages will now be automatically skipped on CRAN;
-   A new expectation `expect_shape()` to check the dimensions, number of rows or number of columns!

## A Git trick: keeping Git blame informative

If you reformat your whole codebase with Air, you'll end up with one or several commits that only change the aspect of your code. A good code style is tantamount to readability, but when you're exploring the history through Git blame, that commit or those commits are not relevant. This problem is solvable!

Thanks to Hugo Gruson to telling us this: you can create (and .Rbuildignore) a file called `.git-blame-ignore-revs` where you list the hashes of the commits you want to exclude from Git blame.

Example in [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/blob/d695714d301819cde6013ecd40a9116880f394ad/.git-blame-ignore-rev):

``` txt
# This file lists revisions of large-scale formatting/style changes so that
# they can be excluded from git blame results.
#
# To set this file as the default ignore file for git blame, run:
#   $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/pull/2121
13d17788e5d3a54fa83beed25e325703608f8b9f
```

To use this file,

-   you tell your local Git about it by running `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`;
-   GitHub, on the other hand, automatically [picks it up](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-and-understanding-files#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view)!

## Another Git trick: rebase all commits

Imagine you work on a private repository, on a single branch, not bothering about a clean Git history. Then you have to make the repository public. How to fix up the history before doing so?

You can rebase all the commits on main (or any branch) using the `--root` option of `git rebase`. So you can type `git rebase -i --root` and, say, combine all the commits into a very deceitful "First commit"!

You can practice [`git rebase -i`](https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/reference/exo_rebase_i.html) with the saperlipopette R package.
