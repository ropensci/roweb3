### rOpenSci Dev Guide Now Available in Portuguese!

rOpenSci has published the Portuguese translation of the "Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review" guide, expanding access to best practices in R package development across the Portuguese-speaking world.

The two-year, community-led effort brought together contributors from Angola, Brazil, and Portugal, following rOpenSci's open workflow with automated translation, multi-reviewer editing, and collaborative decisions on terminology and inclusivity.

This new version strengthens rOpenSci's multilingual infrastructure and helps lower language barriers for contributors.

### Big Team Collaboration on Data Management and Analysis with rOpenSci

[Liz Hare](/author/liz-hare) and [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/) gave a talk on Big Team Collaboration on Software Peer Review with rOpenSci at the Big Team Science Conference 2025. The slides and recording have been [posted](/events/BTSConf-2025)!

### rOpenSci at posit::conf(2025): recordings

### Blog contributor roles in rOpenSci and beyond

We recently added support for contributor roles on our [blog](/blog/2025/10/14/blog-roles/): author, editor, translator, interviewee. Rogue Scholar, that generates the DOI of our posts (and many others'), also added this feature. Read more in their [announcement](https://blog.front-matter.de/posts/supporting-blog-contributions-beyond-authorship/). Thanks to Martin Fenner for supporting our efforts in recognizing all contributions to blog posts!

### Software Review

-   [Translating the rOpenSci Dev Guide into Portuguese: Collaboration, Community, Challenges, and Impact](/blog/2025/11/25/translation-devguide-pt) by Francesca Belem Lopes Palmeira, Beatriz Milz, Ariana Moura Cabral, Yanina Bellini Saibene, Daniel Vartanian, and Pedro Faria. We are very pleased to announce that our guide on package development, maintenance, and peer review is now available in Portuguese. In this blog post, the people who led the translation project share how the process unfolded, the challenges faced, the results achieved, and what participating in this effort meant to them. Other languages: <a href='/pt/blog/2025/11/25/tradução-devguide-pt' lang='pt'>Traduzindo o Dev Guide da rOpenSci para o Português: Colaboração, Comunidade, Desafios e Impacto (pt)</a>.

-   [Computo - A Journal for Transparent and Reproducible Research in Statistics and Machine Learning](/blog/2025/11/06/computo-journal-reproducible-research-statistics-machine-learning) by Julien Chiquet, François-David Collin, Marie-Pierre Etienne, Pierre Neuvial, Aymeric Stamm, and Nelle Varoquaux. [Computo](https://computo-journal.org) is a journal promoting methodological, computational, and algorithmic contributions in statistics and machine learning that provide a better understanding of which models or methods are most appropriate to answer specific scientific questions. Computo leverages modern tools in programming and scientific reporting to support more transparent, interactive, and reproducible research outputs.

## Calls for contributions

### Calls for maintainers

If you're interested in maintaining any of the R packages below, you might enjoy reading our blog post [What Does It Mean to Maintain a Package?](/blog/2023/02/07/what-does-it-mean-to-maintain-a-package/).

[photosearcher](https://docs.ropensci.org/photosearcher), searches Flickr for photographs and metadata. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci/photosearcher/issues/22).

### Calls for contributions

Refer to our [help wanted page](/help-wanted/) -- before opening a PR, we recommend asking in the issue whether help is still needed.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Update of the vcr chapter in HTTP testing in R

We've updated the introduction to vcr in the [HTTP testing in R book](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/vcr.html), so that it reflects the current vcr version, in particular the `local_cassette()` function.

### Jarl: just another R linter

Etienne Bacher introduced the new CLI jarl in a [blog post](https://www.etiennebacher.com/posts/2025-11-20-introducing-jarl/). Like Air, it is run in the terminal. Like the flir R package, it can fix bad patterns in R code.

### pkgdown 2.2.0 makes it easier for LLMs to read your documentation

The latest pkgdown version adds a step to the website building, that creates:

-   a Markdown version of all HTML pages;
-   a standard file called `llms.txt` that compiles the content of the homepage and of the reference and article indices.

Read more about this, including how to opt-out (one config line) in the [release announcement](https://tidyverse.org/blog/2025/11/pkgdown-2-2-0/).

### testthat 3.3.0

If you use testthat, don't miss its [release announcement](https://tidyverse.org/blog/2025/11/testthat-3-3-0/)! Of note:

-   A new function `skip_unless_r()` to skip tests depending on the R version;
-   Tests using Suggested packages will now be automatically skipped on CRAN;
-   A new expectation `expect_shape()` to check the dimensions, number of rows or number of columns!

### A Git trick: keeping Git blame informative

If you reformat your whole codebase with Air, you'll end up with one or several commits that only change the aspect of your code. A good code style is tantamount to readability, but when you're exploring the history through Git blame, that commit or those commits are not relevant. This problem is solvable!

Thanks to Hugo Gruson to telling us this: you can create (and .Rbuildignore) a file called `.git-blame-ignore-revs` where you list the hashes of the commits you want to exclude from Git blame.

Example in [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/blob/d695714d301819cde6013ecd40a9116880f394ad/.git-blame-ignore-rev):

``` txt
# This file lists revisions of large-scale formatting/style changes so that
# they can be excluded from git blame results.
#
# To set this file as the default ignore file for git blame, run:
#   $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/pull/2121
13d17788e5d3a54fa83beed25e325703608f8b9f
```

To use this file,

-   you tell your local Git about it by running `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`;
-   GitHub, on the other hand, automatically [picks it up](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-and-understanding-files#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view)!

### Another Git trick: rebase all commits

Imagine you work on a private repository, on a single branch, not bothering about a clean Git history. Then you have to make the repository public. How to fix up the history before doing so?

You can rebase all the commits on main (or any branch) using the `--root` option of `git rebase`. So you can type `git rebase -i --root` and, say, combine all the commits into a very deceitful "First commit"!

You can practice [`git rebase -i`](https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/reference/exo_rebase_i.html) with the saperlipopette R package.

### Some talks from posit::conf(2025)
