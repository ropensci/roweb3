Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/08/31/ropensci-news-digest-august-2021).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Recordings of useR! 2021

Recordings of useR! 2021 are now available on the [conference website](https://user2021.r-project.org/recordings/).

You can watch contributions by rOpenSci staff:

* Jeroen Ooms' keynote talk about the [**R-universe project**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cv2qsZ_xZw&list=PL4IzsxWztPdmHoJwIVa4um44w2GMjctmP&index=8) ([slidedeck](https://jeroen.github.io/user2021/#1));

### Recordings of AOS/SCO-SOC 2021

rOpenSci staff presented at this year's joint meeting of the American Ornithological Society and the Society of Canadian Ornithologists / Société des ornithologistes du Canada in the lightning symposium ["Great R packages for ornithologists"](https://steffilazerte.ca/presentations.html#Great-R-packages-for-Ornithologists) organized by Steffi LaZerte:

- Steffi LaZerte's opening talk [**How can ornithologists find R packages?**](https://steffilazerte.ca/Presentations/2021-08%20AOS%7CSOC%20-%20R%20Symposium/AOS_SCO_2021_LaZerte.mp4) ([slidedeck](https://steffilazerte.ca/Presentations/2021-08%20AOS%7CSOC%20-%20R%20Symposium/AOS_SCO_2021_LaZerte.html#1));

### Social coworking!

We're excited to announce that we'll be hosting monthly social coworking + office hours sessions via Zoom, starting September 7th!
Coworking is a great way to be productive and reduce feelings of social isolation (especially important over the last year)!
Our first two sessions take place **[Tuesday September 7th 2021 9-11am American Pacific](/events/coworking-2021-09/)** hosted by [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/) and **[Tuesday October 5th 2021 9-11am Australian Western](/events/coworking-2021-10/)** hosted by [Nick Tierney](/author/nicholas-tierney/).
Find more details in our [blog post](/blog/2021/08/17/coworking-sessions/).

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

Do you maintain an R package on CRAN that has some tricky tests e.g. accessing a web API?
With the tools presented in [the online book "HTTP testing in R"](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/) you can build some more robustness in your tests by e.g. using cached API responses instead of hitting the actual web service.
However, bad things can still happen on CRAN therefore a whole chapter is dedicated to [CRAN preparedness](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/cran-preparedness.html), with the suggestion to skip a few tests or even all of them... as long as you are running them regularly yourself on some CI service.

Have you ever gotten the R CMD check NOTE "Namespace in Imports field not imported from" on some CRAN check platform for instance?
It might indicate you forgot to remove a dependency from DESCRIPTION after ditching it from actual code... or that you are using it at the top-level rather than in the body of a function, which is where that check looks for usage!
E.g. if you use [memoise](https://memoise.r-lib.org/) to create a memoised version of a function `m_bla <- memoise::memoise(bla)`, you will have to add an explicit import statement e.g. `#' @importFrom memoise memoise` with roxygen2.
Thanks to rOpenSci Mark Padgham, and to Jim Hester for chiming in [rOpenSci semi-open slack](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels).
