Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/09/30/ropensci-news-digest-september-2021).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

A first package was submitted to [rOpenSci Statistical Software Peer Review](/stat-software-review/), two months after its [opening](/blog/2021/07/23/ropensci-news-digest-july-2021/): the [tsbox package](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/464) by [Christoph Sax](https://github.com/christophsax). 
We are very excited, and thankful for the opportunity to hone our new software review tooling!
