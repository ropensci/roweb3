Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/09/30/ropensci-news-digest-september-2021).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

A first package was submitted to [rOpenSci Statistical Software Peer Review](/stat-software-review/), two months after its [opening](/blog/2021/07/23/ropensci-news-digest-july-2021/): the [tsbox package](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/464) by [Christoph Sax](https://github.com/christophsax). 
We are very excited, and thankful for the opportunity to hone our new software review tooling!

We've made it easier to browse our [website](/) by adding some basic search from the navbar.
The search isn't on the full content, but on page titles and descriptions. 
We hope it'll help you find what you're after!
Other ways to find an rOpenSci related thing you vaguely remember is [asking us](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels), scoring through [our website source](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/) or using your favourite search engine.

Our next Social Coworking and Office Hours is [Tuesday, October 5th, 9 AM Australian Western / 1:00 UTC](/events/coworking-2021-10/), and hosted by [Nicholas Tierney](/author/nicholas-tierney/).

### Tech Notes

* [rOpenSci docs are now built on r-universe](/blog/2021/09/03/runiverse-docs) by Jeroen Ooms. As of today, the pkgdown sites for all rOpenSci packages on our docs server are built on r-universe.

* [How to Use System Commands in your R Script or Package](/blog/2021/09/13/system-calls-R-package) by Jeroen Ooms, Maëlle Salmon. Ways (not) to call the system from your R package.

## Use cases



Three use cases of our packages and resources have been reported since we sent the last newsletter.

* [Bayesian Regression Analysis with Rstanarm (with GSODR for supporting data)](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/bayesian-regression-analysis-with-rstanarm-with-gsodr-for-supporting-data/2603). Reported by Adam Sparks.

* [Slicing an image with magick for artistic effect](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/slicing-an-image-with-magick-for-artistic-effect/2609). Reported by Georgios Karamanis.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

Short anti-struggle list:

* Struggling to write graceful R package examples for CRAN?
Let's remind you of [`@examplesIf` in the latest `roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#functions).

* Struggling with GitHub Actions and dependencies installed from an additional repository? (E.g. [an R-universe repository](/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/)?)
The r-lib setup-r action now has a [`extra-repositories` input](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/8f28ffb1dc3d672a7d1beec9f4869f5d86168b10/setup-r/action.yml#L46).

* Struggling with encoding in particular a NOTE about UTF-8 strings? Read the [related thread on our forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/note-on-utf-8-strings-by-goodpractice-gp/2165).

How to test code run by [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/), while having tests contribute to code coverage?
[covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/) modifies the code through injecting tracing symbols and running as its own temporary and definitely self-contained process. 
Any processes external to this, which includes anything via callr, cannot be traced. 
This is an entirely standard condition of any code tracing algorithm. 
A good tip is to ensure everything inside a callr call is bundled as a simple function that can be tested in tests without the callr wrapper.

Another challenge for testing might be interactive behavior. 
For Shiny apps you might look into [shinytest](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/), for anything happening in the browser you might enjoy [chromote](https://rstudio.github.io/chromote/) or [crrri](https://rlesur.github.io/crrri/).
You can also resort to [mocking](https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/10/29/mocking/).
For code that's supposed to be only run in interactive sessions, you might use [rlang functions in particular the `rlang::is_interactive()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_interactive.html) in code and tests. 
You can look at the [targets testing suite for external processes](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/tree/main/tests/interactive) and [usethis manual tests](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/tree/master/tests/manual).

Now about real testers, i.e. the users! :wink:
To help them use your package optimally, you have to write a nice interface, good docs including about system requirements, informative error messages, etc.
Have you also considered adding some sort of sitrep (situation report) function?
The devtools package has [`devtools::dev_sitrep()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/dev_sitrep.html) e.g. reports on the package development situation, with clear hints given if something is not quite right.
The usethis package has [`usethis::git_sitrep()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/git_sitrep.html) (using the gert package under the hood!), blogdown has [`blogdown::check_site()`](https://alison.netlify.app/ares-kind-tools/#114).
Good candidates for checks are common pain points, so finding them might require some sort of external perspective on your package.`
