<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/09/30/ropensci-news-digest-september-2021).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

A first package was submitted to [rOpenSci Statistical Software Peer Review](/software-review/), two months after its [opening](/blog/2021/07/23/ropensci-news-digest-july-2021/): the [tsbox package](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/464) by [Christoph Sax](https://github.com/christophsax). 
We are very excited, and thankful for the opportunity to hone our new software review tooling!

We've made it easier to browse our [website](/) by adding some basic search from the navbar.
The search isn't on the full content, but on page titles and descriptions. 
We hope it'll help you find what you're after!
Other ways to find an rOpenSci related thing you vaguely remember is by [asking us](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels), searching through [our website source](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/) or using your favourite search engine.

Our next Social Coworking and Office Hours is [Tuesday, October 5th, 9 AM Australian Western / 1:00 UTC](/events/coworking-2021-10/), and hosted by [Nicholas Tierney](/author/nicholas-tierney/).
Find out about [more events](/events).

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following three packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [allodb](https://docs.ropensci.org/allodb), developed by Erika Gonzalez-Akre together with Camille Piponiot, Mauro Lepore, Kristina Anderson-Teixeira: Tool to standardize and simplify the tree biomass estimation process across globally distributed extratropical forests. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/436) by Jeffrey Hanson, Jonas Stillhard.

+ [jagstargets](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets), developed by William Michael Landau: Bayesian data analysis usually incurs long runtimes and cumbersome custom code. A pipeline toolkit tailored to Bayesian statisticians, the jagstargets R package is leverages targets and R2jags to ease this burden. jagstargets makes it super easy to set up scalable JAGS pipelines that automatically parallelize the computation and skip expensive steps when the results are already up to date. Minimal custom code is required, and there is no need to manually configure branching, so usage is much easier than targets alone. For the underlying methodology, please refer to the documentation of targets <doi:10.21105/joss.02959> and JAGS (Plummer 2003) <https://www.r-project.org/conferences/DSC-2003/Proceedings/Plummer.pdf>. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/425) by David Lawrence Miller,  Ernest Guevarra.

+ [slopes](https://docs.ropensci.org/slopes), developed by Robin Lovelace together with Rosa Félix, Joey Talbot: Functions and example data to support research into the slope (also known as longitudinal gradient or steepness) of linear geographic entities such as roads <doi:10.1038/s41597-019-0147-x> and rivers <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.06.066>. The package was initially developed to calculate the steepness of street segments but can be used to calculate steepness of any linear feature that can be represented as LINESTRING geometries in the sf class system. The package takes two main types of input data for slope calculation: vector geographic objects representing linear features, and raster geographic objects with elevation values (which can be downloaded using functionality in the package) representing a continuous terrain surface. Where no raster object is provided the package attempts to download elevation data using the ceramic package. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/420) by Dan Olner, Andy Teucher.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

Short anti-struggle list:

* Struggling to write [graceful](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/graceful.html) R package examples for CRAN?
Let's remind you of [`@examplesIf` in the latest `roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#functions).

* Struggling with GitHub Actions and dependencies installed from an additional repository? (E.g. [an R-universe repository](/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/)?)
The r-lib setup-r action now has a [`extra-repositories` input](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/8f28ffb1dc3d672a7d1beec9f4869f5d86168b10/setup-r/action.yml#L46).

* Struggling with encoding in particular a NOTE about UTF-8 strings? Read the [related thread on our forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/note-on-utf-8-strings-by-goodpractice-gp/2165).

How to test code run by [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/), while having tests contribute to code coverage?
[covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/) modifies the code through injecting tracing symbols and running as its own temporary and definitely self-contained process. 
Any processes external to this, which includes anything via callr, cannot be traced. 
This is an entirely standard condition of any code tracing algorithm. 
A good tip is to ensure everything inside a callr call is bundled as a simple function that can be tested in tests without the callr wrapper.

Another challenge for testing might be interactive behavior. 
For Shiny apps you might look into [shinytest](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/), for anything happening in the browser you might enjoy [chromote](https://rstudio.github.io/chromote/) or [crrri](https://rlesur.github.io/crrri/).
You can also resort to [mocking](https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/10/29/mocking/).
For code that's supposed to be only run in interactive sessions, you might use [rlang functions in particular the `rlang::is_interactive()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_interactive.html) in code and tests. 
You can look at the [targets testing suite for external processes](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/tree/main/tests/interactive) and [usethis manual tests](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/tree/master/tests/manual).

Now about real testers, i.e. the users! :wink:
To help them use your package optimally, you have to write a nice interface, good docs (including system requirements), informative error messages, etc.
Have you also considered adding some sort of sitrep (situation report) function?
The devtools package has [`devtools::dev_sitrep()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/dev_sitrep.html) e.g. reports on the package development situation, with clear hints given if something is not quite right.
The usethis package has [`usethis::git_sitrep()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/git_sitrep.html) (using the gert package under the hood!), blogdown has [`blogdown::check_site()`](https://alison.netlify.app/ares-kind-tools/#114).
Good candidates for checks are common pain points, so finding them might require some sort of external perspective on your package.
