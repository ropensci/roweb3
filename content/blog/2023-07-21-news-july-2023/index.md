Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2023/07/21/news-july-2023).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Open Call for rOpenSci Champions Program Applications! 

We are pleased to [open the call](/blog/2023/07/14/call-champions-program/) for the second cohort of Champions and Mentors for the rOpenSci Champions Program ðŸŽ‰ ! 

This 12-month-long program will continue to support our goal of identifying, recognizing, and rewarding passionate community members who help the community grow and improve.  The activities include cohort-based training, project development, and personal mentorship.

This program focuses on people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and research software communities.

You can apply to be a _champion_ or a _mentor_ until **September 4th**.

More information on eligibility, timeline, curriculum, application process, etc. is [on the program webpage](/champions/). 

### Community call: Mentoring & Training Program for Scientific Open Source Champions

Tuesday, 25 July 2023 14:00 UTC. [More info](/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/).

Champions programs are designed to identify, recognize, and reward emerging leaders within a community. The [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities, which means that it needs to be sustainable and open, and built by and for all groups.

On this [call](/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/) _Beatriz Milz_, _Victor Ordu_ and _Carolina Pradier_ will share their experience of being rOpenSci mentors and champions. 
We will highlight the benefits of being part of the program for you and for your community, what kind of learning, 
activities and opportunities an open source community champions program provides. 
rOpenSci Community Manager _Yani_ will present the details of our Champion Program and answer all your questions about it.



### CRAN packages on R-universe

#### All CRAN packages indexed on R-universe!

We have now indexed all CRAN packages on [r-universe.dev](https://r-universe.dev). You can use the R-universe [powersearch](/blog/2023/02/27/runiverse-discovering/#level-1-searching-the-entire-r-ecosystem) to find any CRAN package with a particular topic, author, datasets etc.

#### R-universe cran.dev shortlinks

You can now use cran.dev shortlinks: `https://cran.dev/{package}`, `https://docs.cran.dev/{package}` to fly directly to the R-universe dev page or html manual for any CRAN package!

Example: <https://cran.dev/xml2> and <https://docs.cran.dev/xml2>.

## Call for maintainers

If you're interested in maintaining any of the R packages below, you might enjoy reading our blog post [What Does It Mean to Maintain a Package?](/blog/2023/02/07/what-does-it-mean-to-maintain-a-package/) (or listening to its discussion on the [R Weekly highlights podcast](https://rweekly.fireside.fm/111) hosted by Eric Nantz and Mike Thomas)!

- **[rvertnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvertnet/index.html)**, Retrieve, map and summarize data from the VertNet.org archives (<https://vertnet.org/>). Functions allow searching by many parameters, including taxonomic names, places, and dates. In addition, there is an interface for conducting spatially delimited searches, and another for requesting large datasets via email. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/rvertnet/issues/71).

- **[natserv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/natserv/index.html)**. Interface to NatureServe (<https://www.natureserve.org/>). Includes methods to get data, image metadata, search taxonomic names, and make maps. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/natserv/issues/29).

### Call for comaintainers

Refer to our somewhat [recent blog post](/blog/2022/10/17/maintain-or-co-maintain-an-ropensci-package/#packages-looking-for-co-maintainers) to identify other packages where help is especially wished for!
See also our [help wanted page](/help-wanted/) -- before opening a PR, we recommend asking in the issue whether help is still needed.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Check for partial matching as part of your testing & CI process

You can change your options to generate warnings on partial matching:

```r
options(
  warnPartialMatchAttr = TRUE,
  warnPartialMatchDollar = TRUE,
  warnPartialMatchArgs = TRUE 
)
```

But your options and [Rprofile](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#rprofile) are ignored by R CMD check.

A way to still get warnings in your continuous integration is to integrate it to testthat by creating a [special `setup-options.R` file](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/11/18/testthat-utility-belt/), as in https://github.com/epiverse-trace/packagetemplate/pull/61. This file could also be used to change any other options (but use with caution to not create situations where it's too difficult to debug).

Thanks to [Hugo Gruson](/author/hugo-gruson/) for this tip!

### Change in R-devel for comparing versions

Does your package compare version with code snippets like `some_version >= 1.5`?
If so, you might encounter the warning below with R-devel.

```
Condition
  Warning in `.make_numeric_version()`:
  invalid non-character version specification 'x' (type: double)
```

[Reference](https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18548), [toot](https://mastodon.social/@zkamvar@fosstodon.org/110634968544104625).

> To avoid it, you need to make your comparison a character vector:
`some_version >= '1.5'` 

[Example commit fixing this, in usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/commit/a5e80b516154309dd28d09e642ea7e7b6c7e723a).

Thanks to [Zhian Kamvar](author/zhian-n.-kamvar/) for this tip!
