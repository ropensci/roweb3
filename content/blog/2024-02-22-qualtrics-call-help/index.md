preface: |
  One of the best things about open software is that it can be a community project with contributions from people other than just the maintainer.
  Sometimes those contributions are opportunistic, and sometimes maintainers solicit specific contributions, and that’s the case here!

The package [qualtRics](https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics) maintained by [Julia Silge](/author/julia-silge) together with [Joseph O’Brien](/author/joseph-obrien) provides functions to access survey results directly into R using the Qualtrics API. Qualtrics <https://www.qualtrics.com/about/> is an online survey and data collection software platform. 



## Help test or improve qualtRics!

Are you a heavy user of the Qualtrics survey tooling in general, and of the qualRics R package in particular? Then you can help build and test the package.

## How to help?

TODO how to volunteer.
Please open an issue in the qualRics Github repository https://github.com/ropensci/qualtRics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc, or comment on a relevant open issue.
