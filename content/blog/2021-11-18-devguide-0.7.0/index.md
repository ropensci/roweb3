rOpenSci Software Peer Review's guidance is gathered in [an online book](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/) and keeps improving!
To find out what's new in our dev guide 0.7.0, you can [read the changelog](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/booknews.html), 
or this blog post for more digested information.

## @ropensci-review-bot help: less TODOs, more simple commands!

A big change brought in this release is the retirement of some of our multiple TODOs for editors in favor of simple bot commands such as `@ropensci-review-bot check package`. 
Our [editor guide](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/editorguide.html) is now simpler! 

For context, rOpenSci has worked with The [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) to extend JOSSâ€™s approach of [chatops-driven publishing](https://www.arfon.org/chatops-driven-publishing) into a new GitHub chat-bot that manages our editorial process: assigning tasks, tagging issues, running tests on software submissions, and returning reports to reviewers and editors, logging reviews in an external (Airtable) database, all from the comfort of a GitHub issue comment. 
Chat-ops automation has been critical to JOSSâ€™s success, and shows huge promise for automating even more tedious tasks like frequent software checks and compliance with best practices.

## Still some work for editors ðŸ˜‰

## Mention relevant rOpenSci projects

We've sprinkled the dev guide with mentions of rOpenSci projects relevant to software review participants:

* We've linked to Statistical Software Peer Review from the [software review introduction](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/softwarereviewintro.html) and from the [very first page of the book](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/index.html),

* We present the pkgcheck package created and maintained by Mark Padgham in the author guide as using it enables authors to ensure their package is ready for submission.

* In the packaging guide, we now give precise examples of tools for installation instructions: the r-lib remotes and pak packages but also R-universe!

* 2021-11-04, add editors' responsabilities including  Editor etiquette for commenting on packages on which you aren't handling/reviewing (@jhollist, #354). 

* 2021-11-04, give precise examples of tools for installation instructions (remotes, pak, R-universe).


* 2021-10-07, add guidance for editorial management (recruiting, inviting, onboarding, offboarding editors).

* 2021-09-14, add a requirement that there is at least one _HTML_ vignette.

* 2021-05-20, add guidance around setting up your package to foster a community, inspired by the recent rOpenSci community call. (with help from `@Bisaloo`, #289, #308)

* 2021-04-27, no longer ask reviewers to ask covr as it'll be done by automatic tools, but ask them to pay attention to tests skipped.

* 2021-04-02, add citation guidance.

* 2021-04-02, stop asking reviewers to run goodpractice as this is part of editorial checks.

## Conclusion

In this post we summarized the changes incorporated into our book ["rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review"](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/) over the last months. 
We are thankful for all contributions that shaped this release. 
We are already working on the next version, such as pondering [whether to make the review template an R Markdown file](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide/issues/340) and [whether to make a distinct chapter out of contributing guide standards](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide/issues/334)
