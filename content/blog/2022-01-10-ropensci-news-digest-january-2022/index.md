### Tech Notes

* [How renv restores packages from r-universe for reproducibility or production](/blog/2022/01/06/runiverse-renv) by Jeroen Ooms. The latest version of renv now supports restoring packages that were installed from r-universe. In this post we explain how this works, and why it has to work this way.

## Use cases



One use cases of our packages and resources have been reported since we sent the last newsletter.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### To quote or not to quote (non-existing words in DESCRIPTION)?

To avoid spelling NOTEs, it is recommended to [_"Put the names of R packages, software, and APIs inside single quotes."_ in `DESCRIPTION`](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html) (as phrased in the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan).

Now, there is a hack allowing you to not add the quotes, as seen in e.g. [RPostgres](https://github.com/cran/RPostgres/tree/master/.aspell).
Say you use the non-existing words "changelog" and "versioning" in the `DESCRIPTION` of your package `coolstuff`.
Two steps!

* Run `saveRDS(c("versioning", "changelog"), file = ".aspell/coolstuff.rds", version = 2)` which will create a file with these words!
* Add a script `.aspell/defaults.R` that will refer to both the standard dictionary ("en_stats") and the one you just created ("coolstuff").

```r
Rd_files <- vignettes <- R_files <- description <-
    list(encoding = "UTF-8",
         language = "en",
         dictionaries = c("en_stats", "coolstuff"))
```

Voilà, goodbye quotes in `DESCRIPTION`!
Thanks to [Jim Hester and Kirill Müller](https://github.com/cynkra/fledge/pull/171#discussion_r762045958) for this cool trick that's not [used a lot](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Acran+extension%3Ards+path%3A.aspell&type=Code&l=&l=) (yet?).
It _is_ documented in R, see the sentence beginning with "Suitable values for" in https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/utils/html/aspell-utils.html

### potools: Translate your package user-facing communications like messages, warnings, and errors

Your package might be used by people at ease in different languages than the one you initially wrote e.g. error messages in.
The [potools package](https://michaelchirico.github.io/potools/index.html) maintained by (Michael Chirico)[https://github.com/MichaelChirico] provides "Tools for Portability and Internationalization of R packages".
It features great vignettes including one for [package developers](https://michaelchirico.github.io/potools/articles/developers.html) and one for [package creators](https://michaelchirico.github.io/potools/articles/translators.html).
The potools package is used in particular in the pkgdown package ([user-facing docs for the language option](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html?q=language#language).

### How to provide tibbles only to those who like them

"Only use tibbles if tibble installed": this sounds great, doesn't it?
It's the title of a [PR by Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/pull/25) to the palmerpenguins package maintained by Allison Horst.
Key to this PR is the used of `delayedAssign()` in `data/penguins.R`.
The code changes are small enough to make this a really cool trick!
