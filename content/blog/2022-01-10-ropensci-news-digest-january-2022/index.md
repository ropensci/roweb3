### Tech Notes

* [How renv restores packages from r-universe for reproducibility or production](/blog/2022/01/06/runiverse-renv) by Jeroen Ooms. The latest version of renv now supports restoring packages that were installed from r-universe. In this post we explain how this works, and why it has to work this way.

## Use cases



One use cases of our packages and resources have been reported since we sent the last newsletter.

* [Evaluating semi-parametric nowcasts of COVID-19 hospital admissions in Germany](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/evaluating-semi-parametric-nowcasts-of-covid-19-hospital-admissions-in-germany/2715). Reported by Sam Abbott.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### To quote or not to quote (non-existing words in DESCRIPTION)?

To avoid spelling NOTEs, it is recommended to [_"Put the names of R packages, software, and APIs inside single quotes."_ in `DESCRIPTION`](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html) (as phrased in the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan).

Now, there is a hack allowing you to not add the quotes, as seen in e.g. [RPostgres](https://github.com/cran/RPostgres/tree/master/.aspell).
Say you use the non-existing words "changelog" and "versioning" in the `DESCRIPTION` of your package `coolstuff`.
Two steps!

* Run `saveRDS(c("versioning", "changelog"), file = ".aspell/coolstuff.rds", version = 2)` which will create a file with these words!
* Add a script `.aspell/defaults.R` that will refer to both the standard dictionary ("en_stats") and the one you just created ("coolstuff").

```r
Rd_files <- vignettes <- R_files <- description <-
    list(encoding = "UTF-8",
         language = "en",
         dictionaries = c("en_stats", "coolstuff"))
```

Voilà, goodbye quotes in `DESCRIPTION`!
Thanks to [Jim Hester and Kirill Müller](https://github.com/cynkra/fledge/pull/171#discussion_r762045958) for this cool trick that's not [used a lot](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Acran+extension%3Ards+path%3A.aspell&type=Code&l=&l=) (yet?).
