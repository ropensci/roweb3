Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/03/18/ropensci-news-digest-march-2022).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### R-universe gets advanced search!

The landing page for rOpenSci's [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev) platform has gotten a makeover to facilitate easy searching through thousands of available R packages and articles. Discover new content by searching for keywords in package descriptions, authors, topics, vignettes, etc.

{{< figure src="landing.jpeg" alt="New R-universe landing page. There is a search bar. Below it are the logos of organizations. Above it is an animated rocket icon." >}}

Give it a try at [https://r-universe.dev](https://r-universe.dev)!

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following four packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [commonmark](https://docs.ropensci.org/commonmark), developed by Jeroen Ooms: The CommonMark specification defines a rationalized version of markdown syntax. This package uses the cmark reference implementation for converting markdown text into various formats including html, latex and groff man. In addition it exposes the markdown parse tree in xml format. Also includes opt-in support for GFM extensions including tables, autolinks, and strikethrough text.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=commonmark). 

+ [gendercoder](https://docs.ropensci.org/gendercoder), developed by Emily Kothe together with Jennifer Beaudry, Felix Singleton Thorn, Rhydwyn McGuire, Nicholas Tierney, and Mathew Ling: Provides functions and dictionaries for recoding of freetext gender responses into more consistent categories. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/435) by Julia Silge, and Elin Waring.

+ [occCite](https://docs.ropensci.org/occCite), developed by Hannah L. Owens together with Cory Merow, Brian Maitner, Jamie M. Kass, Vijay Barve, and Robert P. Guralnick: Facilitates the gathering of biodiversity occurrence data from disparate sources. Metadata is managed throughout the process to facilitate reporting and enhanced ability to repeat analyses.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=occCite). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/407) by Damiano Oldoni.

+ [universe](https://docs.ropensci.org/universe), developed by Jeroen Ooms: Utilities to interact with the R-universe platform. Includes functions to manage local package repositories, as well as API wrappers for retrieving data and metadata about packages in r-universe.

## Use cases



One use case of our packages and resources has been reported since we sent the last newsletter.

* [Use rtweet to manage lists and who you follow](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/use-rtweet-to-manage-lists-and-who-you-follow/2830). Reported by Steph Locke.

Explore [other use cases](/usecases) and [report your own](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases/10)!

## Call for maintainers

The [rrricanes package](https://docs.ropensci.org/rrricanes/) is looking for a new maintainer!
rrricanes is a web scraper for Atlantic and east Pacific hurricanes and tropical storms.
See [the corresponding GitHub issue](https://github.com/ropensci/rrricanes/issues/127).

You can refer to:

* [our guidance on _Changing package maintainers_](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html)
* [our _Package Curation Policy_](https://devguide.ropensci.org/curationpolicy.html)

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Get inspired by the tidyverse spring cleaning

The tidyverse packages have been undergoing spring cleaning helped by a [public checklist](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/blob/19c9e5e43ab430ca0ff3e3075b43b869270e01f0/R/tidy-upkeep.R?rgh-link-date=2022-03-04T14%3A53%3A56Z#L31) that is worth a read (example in the [tidymodels package repository](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/922)).
Some items are specific to tidyverse-affiliated packages, but not all of them.
Others have equivalent e.g. you could run `desc::desc_normalize()` instead of `usethis::use_tidy_description()`.
How many boxes could you already check, how many could you check in a short time for packages of yours? :wink:

On a more meta level, the idea of checklists in issues like with `usethis::use_release_issue()` is quite neat and generalizable.

### roxygen2 tips

One of the items in the aforementioned checklist is `usethis::use_roxygen_md()` for switching to use Markdown in roxygen2 docs.
Much easier for adding bold text, code, etc.

Another good thing to know is that the roxygen2 pkgdown website has guidance on [repeating yourself](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#do-repeat-yourself) in your docs (["Every page is page one"](https://www.writethedocs.org/blog/newsletter-april-2020/#book-club-an-intro-to-every-page-is-page-one)! Or, as written in our [packaging guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html), "the principle of multiple points of entry i.e. to take into account the fact that any piece of documentation may be the first encounter the user has with the package and/or the tool/data it wraps.").
See also the blog post ["Reuse Rmd fragments in package vignettes, README, blog posts and more"](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/dry-vignette-and-readme/) by Garrick Aden-Buie.

Lastly, do you know about katex by Jeroen Ooms for [displaying math in R documentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/katex/reference/math_to_rd.html)?

### Alternatives/complements to pkgdown for package docs?

Documentation websites for rOpenSci packages are happily built with pkgdown.
However depending on your preferences or needs (e.g. what if you want to integrate the docs of your R packages with docs of other non R elements of your pipeline) you might like:

* [r2readthedocs](https://docs.ropensci.org/r2readthedocs/) by Mark Padgham to convert R package documentation to a ‘readthedocs’ website. It is used for documenting [rOpenSci review tools](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ropensci-review-tools/).
* [altdoc](https://altdoc.etiennebacher.com/#/) by Etienne Bacher, that provides helper functions to use docute, docsify, and mkdocs.
