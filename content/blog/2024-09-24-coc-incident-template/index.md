Handling reported incidents related to a Code of Conduct (CoC) is a complex and delicate task. Managing timely and with care is crucial for maintaining a healthy and inclusive community.

To assist with this process, we’ve developed a template, based on the work of the [useR! 2021 CoC Team](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/main/code-of-conduct-response-team-documents.html), designed specifically to analyze [rOpenSci's CoC](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) incident reports. This template aims to provide a structured approach for assessing and addressing reports, ensuring that each report is reviewed with consistency.

In this post, we walk through the key components of the template and how it can support teams in managing CoC incidents effectively.
It must be noted that filing the template is a private, confidential, and internal action of the CoC team. The information on the template is not shared with other rOpenSci members nor is published. Annual transparency reports to be shared with the community may include **anonymized** descriptions of the reported incidents and the actions that had been taken.

## The Template

-   **Report ID**: a code to identify each report uniquely.

-   **Date and time of the report**: to track the time to response in order to comply with our process. For example, our policy is to send a first acknowledgment email within 24 hours of receiving a report.

-   **Medium use to report**: form, direct message, email, phone, personal conversation.

-   **First deadline clock**: to a public acknowledgement.

-   **Second deadline clock**: to a decision.

-   **Reporter(s) contact information**: for quick communication during the process.

-   **Receive the incident report - checklist**: this checklist have the steps that each person on the CoC Team has to take. For example:

    -   Email [conduct\@ropensci.org](mailto:conduct@ropensci.org){.email} to mark dates and timeline for planned response.

    -   Open new document with Committee-only permissions and link to sheet of reported information.

    -   Email person reporting to acknowledge receipt and cc [conduct\@ropensci.org](mailto:conduct@ropensci.org){.email} (see template).

    -   ...

-   **Reported person's name**:

-   **Target/s**:

-   **Witnesses**:

-   **First person in CoC team**: the person that first receives the report and triggers the process to handle it.

- **Conflict of interest**: check if any member of the CoC team may have a conflict of interest. In that case, the recused person will be excluded from the process, and the independent community member is allowed to ask for the assistance of an extra independent person (preferring people with experience in CoC teams of other communities).
-   **Small CoC team**: the team that is handling the report, which may be smaller than the CoC team.

-   **Incident - brief description**: (anonymize for the final version)

-   **Incident - evidence**: for example emails, screenshots of direct or public messages in different platforms like Slack, GitHub, Discord, Discourse.

-   **Type of (possible) rOpenSci CoC unacceptable behavior:** create a check list with the list of not accepted behaviors for the assesment, based on the current Code of Conduct. Remember the list is not exhaustive.

    -   offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), nationality, native language, or technology choices.

    -   unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment.

    -   sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events, including online discussion.

    -   deliberate intimidation.

    -   continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.

    -   unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.

    -   pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.

    -   inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop. In virtual settings, inappropriate simulated physical contact used without consent, such as textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub” or emojis representing such contacts.

    -   stalking or following, including in virtual settings behavior such as persistent unwanted direct messages, sending unwanted pictures or malware links, or logging online activity for harassment purposes.

    -   threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.

    -   use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes.

    -   unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favors, or repeatedly asking for dates or contact information.

    -   deliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse

    -   deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names

    -   non-consensual publication of non-harassing private communication, including screenshots of private discussion channels or direct messages.

        We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

        -   ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’

        -   reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”

        -   communicating in a ’tone’ you don’t find congenial

        -   criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

* **Response:** this section explains the incident, the decision made by the CoC committee, and the reason for that decision.

* **Actions to implement the response**: detail of the actions to take by the CoC committee and other teams of the organization as a response.  

* **Inform the reporter**: date, time and text for the communication of the response. 

* **Inform the reported person**: If necessary: date, time, and text for the communication of the response. Note that the decision may involve taking no action, so communication with the reported person is not mandatory. 

* **Public Statement:** this is the text for the transparency report where we communicate the response to others in an anonymized description.

* **Future actions to avoid this type of incident**: this is part of the reflection process that helps to improve our CoC and our community. This can lead to update the text or create other process and tools.
