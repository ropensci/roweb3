Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/02/18/ropensci-news-digest-february-2022).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### rOpenSci is hiring its next Community Manager!

* Come be part of making our great community even better;

* Help start a new program promoting diverse leadership in open source;

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following three packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [frictionless](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless), developed by Peter Desmet together with Damiano Oldoni: Read and write Frictionless Data Packages. A Data Package (<https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/>) is a simple container format and standard to describe and package a collection of (tabular) data. It is typically used to publish FAIR (<https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>) and open datasets.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frictionless). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/495) by Beatriz Milz, and João Martins.

+ [rfema](https://docs.ropensci.org/rfema), developed by Dylan Turner: `rfema` allows users to access The Federal Emergency Management Agencys (FEMA) publicly available data through their API. The package provides a set of functions to easily navigate and access data from the National Flood Insurance Program along with FEMAs various disaster aid programs, including the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, the Public Assistance Grant Program, and the Individual Assistance Grant Program. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/484) by François Michonneau, and Marcus Beck.

+ [tidytags](https://docs.ropensci.org/tidytags), developed by K. Bret Staudt Willet together with Joshua M. Rosenberg: The tidytags package coordinates the simplicity of collecting tweets over time with a Twitter Archiving Google Sheet (TAGS; <https://tags.hawksey.info/>) and the utility of the rtweet package (<https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/>) for processing and preparing additional Twitter metadata. tidytags also introduces functions developed to facilitate systematic yet flexible analyses of data from Twitter. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/382) by Lluís Revilla Sancho, and Marion Louveaux.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Make the best out of your package logo

Have you designed (or commissioned) a beautiful logo for your package?
Use [`usethis::use_logo()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_logo.html) that will enforce a specific size and save it under `man/figures/logo.png`, as well as providing you with the Markdown code to insert your logo in your package repo README.
Why do this? This has two advantages:

* If you have a package-level doc (i.e. a manual page for `?package-name`), or create one via [`usethis::use_package_doc()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_package_doc.html), roxygen2 will automatically add the logo to that doc page. Type `?usethis` in your R console for an example.

* If you use [pkgdown BS5 templates](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/12/pkgdown-2-0-0/#bootstrap-5), which is the case if your package is part of rOpenSci suite, your package logo will appear on all pages, as well as in social media cards.

### Resources about testing

Some links about testing your package...

* When wondering what good tests look like (spoiler: they look obvious): [Why Good Developers Write Bad Unit Tests](https://mtlynch.io/good-developers-bad-tests/) (seen via [an issue in the R packages book repo](https://github.com/hadley/r-pkgs/issues/551)).
* When things go well in one testing context (say, `devtools::test()`) but not in another one (say, `devtools::check()`): [a conversation around usual suspects](https://github.com/hadley/r-pkgs/issues/483). One prevention strategy is to read and apply the advice in testthat [Test fixtures vignette](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/test-fixtures.html).
* When having to put helper code somewhere: [Helper code and files for your testthat tests](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/11/18/testthat-utility-belt/).
* That interacts with a database: [dittodb by Jonathan Keane and Mauricio Vargas](https://docs.ropensci.org/dittodb/).
* That interacts with a web resource: [HTTP testing in R](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing) (or the more recent [httptest2 package](https://enpiar.com/httptest2/) that is like httptest, but for [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/)).

### The state of continuous integration (CI) for R packages

We no longer recommend using [Travis CI](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/11/19/moving-away-travis/).
The development version of our dev guide has [updated advice on CI](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/ci.html).

If you adopt GitHub Actions,

* Have a look at the [changelog for r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/releases) if these are the actions you use;

* Do not miss the tech note ["pkgcheck now available as a GitHub action!"](/blog/2022/02/01/pkgcheck-action/).

### Miscellaneous package building advice
