This is the R Markdown (.Rmd) template for a blog post or tech note.
To generate your post with just Markdown (.md), use that template instead.

Throughout this template, including the YAML,
you should change "post-template" to the slug of your post,
and "2019-06-04" to your publication date.

Save this file under /content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.Rmd in the local copy of your roweb3 fork.

The chunk below ensures your plots will be inserted in the same folder as your Rmd so you can submit the bundle (.Rmd, .md, images) to roweb3.

The figure paths in the resulting Markdown will already be valid so you won't need to edit the Markdown file.

## Section heading in sentence case

Citation of the primary literature[^1].

Citation of a website[^2].

Citation of an R package[^3].

### Subsection heading

We recommend the use of [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to include images, tweets, videos, gists, etc. In the Rmd file they need to be between `<!--html_preserve-->` and `<!--/html_preserve-->`.

**Add an image** by using a Hugo shortcode. The image is saved under `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/name-of-image.png`.

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< figure "name-of-image.png" "400" "this is the alternative text" >}}
<!--/html_preserve-->

Consult the Technical Guidelines for tips on changing image size, alignment, and for advice on alternative text.

Below is another image, a plot generated by a code chunk, so you might see how to add alternative text in this case.

``` r
plot(1:10)
```

<img
src="index.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/fig-polar-1.png"
id="fig-polar" alt="Figure 1: A line plot on a polar axis" />

Once this file is knitted the plot above will be inserted with the correct syntax.

**Add citation or footnote** text by using the format below
