## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### pak::pak()

Say you cloned a repository and are now getting ready to debug it.
How do you make sure you have all its development dependencies installed?
[Simply](https://twitter.com/GaborCsardi/status/1545306904028741632) run `pak::pak()`! 
Easy to remember and to type, and it works!

### Update to CRAN NEWS.md parsing

If you maintain a [changelog for your package](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/05/08/pkg-news/), as [you should](https://devguide.ropensci.org/releasing.html?q=news#news), and have chosen the Markdown format (`NEWS.md`) to do so, you might need to pay attention to its formatting for optimal parsing by

* pkgdown, see the docs for [`pkgdown::build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_news.html), for instance pay attention to [headings](https://ropensci.org/blog/2022/01/31/package-build-failures/#wrong-newsmd-structure);

* [R itself](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q3/008239.html) -- if all goes well a `NEWS.md` file that is correct for pkgdown will be correct for R too. You can follow the [debugging steps recommended by Henrik Bengtsson](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q3/008238.html) to find what's wrong in your `NEWS.md` file.

### How to handle CRAN checks with `_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_`=true

In some cases CRAN might run [checks without installing the Suggested dependencies](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q2/008193.html).
How to ensure your vignettes still "work", that is to say, that R CMD check will not produce any error or warning?
- [pre-build](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/12/08/precompute-vignettes/) your vignettes;
- make them pkgdown [articles](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_vignette.html) instead (no vignette, no vignette error!);
- execute code conditionally based on the availability of packages, with knitr `eval` chunk option for instance.
