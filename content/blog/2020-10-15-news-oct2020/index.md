## rOpenSci HQ

#### rOpenSci at R-Ladies
Our community manager Stefanie Butland, and one of our software review editors Brooke Anderson, are speaking remotely at an [R-Ladies East Lansing meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-east-lansing/events/272642612/) Thursday, October 22nd. They will talk about our how to get involved in rOpenSci using our new [Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) as an entry point, and through participating in software review as a package author or reviewer.

#### Contributing Guide Release
The purpose of our new [Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) is to welcome you to rOpenSci and help you recognize yourself as a potential contributor. It will help you figure out what you might gain by giving your time, expertise, and experience; match your needs with things that will help rOpenSci’s mission; and connect you with resources to help you along the way.

<!---- ## From the Forum

_We have a discussion forum (using Discourse) for the rOpenSci community. It’s a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we’ll highlight recent discussions of interest._

* Peter Desmet asked a question that many R package maintainers run in to: [What if raw data in package is too large?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/what-if-raw-data-in-package-is-too-large/1955)

## In the News

* One of our software review editors, [Anna Krystalli](https://twitter.com/annakrystalli), was featured in the podcast RSE Stories, in an episode titled [R for Reproducibility](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/anna-krystalli/).

* The latest episode of the Changelog Podcast was [How open source saved htop](https://changelog.com/podcast/413). It may be of interest to readers of our newsletter as a vignette of how a project transitioned maintainers. The [original htop repository](https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/), and [the new one](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop).

## Call For Maintainers

Part of our mission is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Sometimes software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

[**monkeylearn**](https://docs.ropensci.org/monkeylearn/) is in need of a new maintainer. [Comment on this thread](https://github.com/ropensci/monkeylearn/issues/142) if you're interested.
