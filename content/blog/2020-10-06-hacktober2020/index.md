The title of this post refers to Hacktoberfest, a month-long event organized annually by Digital Ocean to encourage contributions to open source projects on GitHub. 
Unfortunately, this October, many maintainers are dealing with [spam pull requests](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/). 
So instead of issuing a general appeal to participate, we're pointing you t our new [Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/)'s section dedicated to our open [Issues List](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#issues).
Along with showing you how to find help wanted issues in rOpenSci packages, it provides suggestions on etiquette to maximize the chances that your effort will be appreciated by a maintainer.  

In 2019, 117 people made their first-ever GitHub commit to rOpenSci. We are excited to welcome code and non-code contributions from new and more seasoned coders at any career stage, and in any sector. 

## For package authors 

- **Make your project collaboration friendly** by including a [code of conduct](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#code-of-conduct) and a brief [contributing guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#friendlyfiles) that tells people how you would like them to interact with your project.
- **Label your issues** so people interested in contributing can find them. We recommend [`help wanted`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) (no hyphen), and where appropriate [`good first issue`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues), [`documentation`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22documentation%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues).
- **Include future plans for your package** in the README and open issues to address aspects of your plan.


## For potential contributors

Many of our packages are developed by people working in research environments where software development is a voluntary, side project. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get an immediate response. It will depend on the popularity of a package and whether maintaining it is part of a person’s “day job”.

- **Address a “Help wanted” issue**. Take a look at the [Issues List](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues). If you see one that interests you, take a look at the project’s contributing guide, then comment in the issue to discuss your approach with the maintainer. Once your proposed plan is accepted, reate a [pull request](#channels-github) and submit your solution.
- **Address any open issue.** The majority of [issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) are not labeled “help wanted” but that doesn’t mean the author wouldn’t appreciate your help. Browse the issues in a package you use and see if there’s one you could address. This is a great way to get your favorite packages work the way you want them to!

## Advice from maintainers in the rOpenSci community

Our [Community Call on Maintaining an R Package](/blog/2020/07/14/commcall-maintaining-pkg/) was a panel discussion with maintainers of both very popular and niche packages talking in part about how they handle contributions. The [summary post](/blog/2020/07/14/commcall-maintaining-pkg/), by [Janani Ravi](/author/janani-ravi/) and [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/), is a goldmine of links to specific segments of the video and collaborative notes on responses to questions like:
- How do you manage issues and feature requests? What workflows do you use to do this? 
- What is a path for new contributors to R packages? How can healthy norms be passed on? 
- If I want to start with fixing an issue or contributing to a well-documented package, what are essential parts I should know?

## January to December

Any month is a good month to contribute to rOpenSci! Find out where your personal motivations to contribute align with our mission and our community values, and choose your path through the [rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/).
