As part of rOpenSci's [multilingual publishing project](/multilingual-publishing/)[^1],  we have been developing the  [babeldown](https://docs.ropensci.org/babeldown/) R package, for translating Markdown-based content using the DeepL API.

[^1]: Thanks to [funding from the R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/awarded-projects/2022-group-2)!

In a previous tech note we demonstrated the [use of babeldown for translating a blog post](/blog/2023/09/26/how-to-translate-a-hugo-blog-post-with-babeldown/) in a workflow supported by Git.
Here we use babeldown for translating **living** documents, such as our  [developer's guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/).
In this case, translations not only need to be created at the time in first writing, but also updated as the document is changed over time.

In this tech note, we'll show how you can use babeldown to update a translation after you've edited a document.

## Initial situation: an English document and its French translation

Let's assume we have an English document called `bla.md`.


```r
dir <- withr::local_tempdir()
file <- file.path(dir, "bla.md")
fs::file_create(file)
english_text <- c("# header", "", "this is some text", "", "## subtitle", "", "nice!")
brio::write_lines(english_text, file)
```


```
# header

this is some text

## subtitle

nice!
```

We have already translated it with babeldown, which provides us with an AI-based translation from DeepL, then edited the translation manually to provide the context the AI missed.


```r
Sys.setenv("DEEPL_API_URL" = "https://api.deepl.com")
Sys.setenv(DEEPL_API_KEY = keyring::key_get("deepl"))

out_file <- file.path(dir, "bla.fr.md")
deepl_translate(
  path = file,
  out_path = out_file,
  source_lang = "EN",
  target_lang = "FR",
  formality = "less",
  yaml_fields = NULL
)
```



Here's the French text:



```
# titre

ceci est du texte

## sous-titre

chouette !
```

At this stage let's set up the Git infrastructure for the folder containing the two documents.
In real life, we might already have it in place.
The important thing is to start tracking changes before we edit the English document again.


```r
gert::git_init(dir)
gert::git_config_set("user.name", "Jane Doe", repo = dir)
gert::git_config_set("user.email", "jane@example.com", repo = dir)
gert::git_add(c(fs::path_file(file), fs::path_file(out_file)), repo = dir)
```

```
       file status staged
1 bla.fr.md    new   TRUE
2    bla.md    new   TRUE
```

```r
gert::git_commit_all("First commit", repo = dir)
```

```
[1] "5b7ae61fb72bd89ee912889207efbce5e662c405"
```

```r
gert::git_log(repo = dir)
```

```
                                    commit                      author
1 5b7ae61fb72bd89ee912889207efbce5e662c405 Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
                 time files merge        message
1 2024-01-16 15:59:49     2 FALSE First commit\n
```

## Changing the English document

Now imagine we change the English document.


```r
new_english_text <- c("# a title", "", "this is some text", "", "awesome", "", "## subtitle", "")
brio::write_lines(
  new_english_text,
  file
)
gert::git_add(fs::path_file(file), repo = dir)
```

```
    file   status staged
1 bla.md modified   TRUE
```

```r
gert::git_commit("Second commit", repo = dir)
```

```
[1] "b398bf63c6c86cb3817d88e40f47afde72158e7a"
```


```
# a title

this is some text

awesome

## subtitle
```

## Updating the translation

We don't want to send the whole document to DeepL API again!
Indeed, we do not want the text fragments that haven't to be updated, as we would lose the improvements from careful work by human translators. 
Furthermore, if we were to send all the text to the API again, we'd be spending unnecessary money (or free credits).

Fortunately we have two babeldown functions at our disposal:

- [`babeldown::deepl_translate_markdown_string()`](http://docs.ropensci.org/babeldown/reference/deepl_translate_markdown_string.html), which sends an individual string for translation.  We could copy-and-paste the changed text into this function. We won't show this approach here.
- [`babeldown::deepl_update()`](http://docs.ropensci.org/babeldown/reference/deepl_update.html) that operates more automatically by sending the lines or blocks of text that have changed for translation.  This may be more text than needed, as it will send whole paragraphs to DeepL API if it changed, even if a single sentence or less changed.


```r
Sys.setenv("DEEPL_API_URL" = "https://api.deepl.com")
Sys.setenv(DEEPL_API_KEY = keyring::key_get("deepl"))
babeldown::deepl_update(
 path = file,
 out_path = out_file,
 source_lang = "EN",
 target_lang = "FR",
 formality = "less",
 yaml_fields = NULL
)
```

Let's look at the new French document:


```
# titre

ceci est du texte

## sous-titre

chouette !
```

One would then carefully look at the Git diff to ensure only what was needed was changed, then commit the automatic translation.
That translation would then be should then be reviewed by a human. For our multilingual work at rOpenSci, a translator (native speaker) reviews all our patches for consistency, tone, and context.

You can also find an example of `babeldown::deepl_update()` in a [Pull request](https://github.com/maelle/auto-update-translations/pull/1): the first two commits update the English document, the third one uses the function to update the Spanish document.

## How `babeldown::deepl_update()` works under the hood

Contrary to what one might guess, `babeldown::deepl_update()` doesn't use the Git diff at all!
Although that definitely was the first idea we explored.

`babeldown::deepl_update()` does scour the Git log to use the snapshot of the main language version that was in sync with the translation.
It's the "old English document", that goes with the "old French document".
The old English document is the English document as it was the last time the French document was featured in a Git commit.
The French document is the French document as it was in that same commit snapshot.

We have the "new English document" and what's missing is the "new French document".
We want that new French document to use as much as possible of the old French document, only using an automatic translation for the parts that are new.

The function uses an XML representation of the documents, as created by [tinkr](https://docs.ropensci.org/tinkr).
A necessary condition for using `babeldown::deepl_update()` is that the old English document and the old French document need to have the same XML structure: say, one heading followed by two paragraphs then a list.

For each child of the body of the new English document (a paragraph, a list, a heading...), `babeldown::deepl_update()` tries finding the same tag in the old English document ([identified by having the same `xml2::xml_text()` and children of the same type](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/babeldown/blob/e8ef563eca232f1ba08b84c7bb0f999d4f452938/R/update.R#L136)).
If it finds the same tag, it uses the tag located at the same position in the old French document.
If it does not find it, it sends it to DeepL API.

A consequence of this approach is that we find the largest matching structural block between two documents. For instance, in  list where we changed one item, the whole list would be re-translated, as opposed to only the item.  However, this also means we use logical blocks, rather than fragments of text as defined by words or line breaks.

## Conclusion

In this post we explained how to use babeldown to update translations of living document.
We at rOpenSci are ourselves users of babeldown for this scenario!
Maintaining translations is time consuming but important work.
We'd be thrilled to hear your feedback if you use `babeldown::deepl_update()`!
