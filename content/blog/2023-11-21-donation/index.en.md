rOpenSci is a nonprofit organization that is funded entirely by grants and donations. These contributions enable us to keep our projects and infrastructure active and accessible to the community. 

Our projects are dedicated to establishing and upholding both technical and social infrastructure that supports open and reproducible science for all our members. This means our efforts must be sustainable, inclusive, and created collaboratively by and for all groups.

Each action taken by rOpenSci seeks to break down barriers to accessing knowledge in the drive to democratize access to quality resources. Examples are the [R-Universe](/r-universe/), the [Champions Program](/champions/), and the [publication of multilingual](/multilingual-publishing/) resources. We also strive to transform science by creating processes and building capacity to ensure software quality and good practices, for example, our ([statistical](/stat-software-review/)) [software peer review](/software-review/). 

Sustaining an open project with quality infrastructure freely accessible to the global and diverse community of R software users, research software developers, and engineers requires many different resources. Our organization's ongoing costs are supported by grants and donations from individuals and organizations which share our vision and mission.


By supporting us, you‚Äôre not just donating; you‚Äôre contributing to a community that‚Äôs breaking down barriers, creating opportunities, and shaping the future of open and reproducible science for everyone. Join us in this vital mission today!
