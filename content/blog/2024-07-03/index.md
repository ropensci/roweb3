We are excited to welcome Beatriz Milz and Margaret Siple to our team of [Associate Editors](/software-review/#editors) for rOpenSci [Software Peer Review](/software-review/).
They join Laura DeCicco, Julia Gustavsen, Anna Krystalli, Mauro Lepore, Noam Ross, MaÃ«lle Salmon, Emily Riederer, Adam Sparks, and Jeff Hollister .
rOpenSci has been running a rigorous and collegial software peer review system since 2015.
Editors [manage the review process](https://devguide.ropensci.org/editorguide.html), performing initial package checks, identifying reviewers, and moderating the process until the package is accepted by reviewers as part of rOpenSci's [software suite](https://ropensci.org/packages/).
To address the scope and volume of packages submitted for review, it's critical that we have a team of editors with complementary expertise.
Beatriz brings here ...
Margaret is know for / works hard at ...
