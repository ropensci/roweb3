Hi, I am Juan Camilo Rojas Hernandez, from Colombia. I am currently working as an international consultant for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). My experience is focused on data analysis for public health surveillance, with special interest in open source tools.

My project in the rOpenSci Champions Program consists of developing a package in R that automates epidemiological surveillance processes, data cleaning and generation of specific analysis for public health institutions in Colombia. This package seeks to improve response times in the field and strengthen the use of open data and official sources.

I was motivated to apply because I consider that this is a great opportunity to learn good practices in the development of R packages and to create tools that generate real impact on public health in my country. In addition, I hope to be able to replicate this knowledge in local communities and contribute to a Latin American network of epidemiology researchers committed to open science.

## Lucía Inés Rodríguez Planes

{{< figure src = "/img/team/lucia-ines-rodriguez-planes.jpeg" width = "250" alt = "Foto de perfil de Lucía Inés Rodríguez Planes" class = "pull-right" caption = "<strong>Lucía Inés Rodríguez Planes </br> Administración de Parques Nacionales </br> R-Ladies Ushuaia </br> </strong>">}}

I am a biologist, university professor and I work in wildlife conservation in southern Patagonia, Argentina. My undergraduate and doctoral training was at the University of Buenos Aires applying research in population dynamics to the management of situations of epidemiological and conservation interest.

Currently I work at the National Parks Administration as a Conservation Science Application Specialist. I have used R to analyze spatial and temporal data from camera traps, long-term wildlife monitoring and evaluation of invasive alien species management plans. I teach ecology to undergraduate and graduate students, technicians and park rangers; and I participate in spaces that promote the inclusion of women and diversity in science and technology, such as R-Ladies Ushuaia.

I plan to develop a package that will be the gateway to code-based solutions for conservation agents with little experience in the use of R. Entirely written in Spanish and with complete demonstrative examples, I want it to become the initial toolbox for new users, from which to build more complex and specific workflows for particular cases. By participating in the Champions Program, I seek to learn how to promote effective dialogue between management and research, propose processes and promote ways of working to strengthen local capacities that can be sustained over time.

## Maria Valentina Clavijo Mesa

{{< figure src = "/img/team/maria-valentina-clavijo-mesa.png" width = "250" alt = "Foto de perfil de Maria Valentina Clavijo Mesa" class = "pull-left" caption = "<strong>Maria Valentina Clavijo Mesa </br>LASAR3. R-Ladies Medellín  </br> </strong>">}}

Hello, my name is Valentina Clavijo and I am a PhD student at the Politecnico di Milano (Italy). I am developing my PhD project in the LASAR3 laboratory, focused on the analysis and evaluation of reliability, risk and resilience of complex systems. I am originally from Medellin, Colombia and currently reside in Milan. I am also co-founder of the R-Ladies Medellín chapter, where I actively promote the participation of women and underrepresented people in data science and R programming.

My project for the Champions Program consists of developing a package in R that facilitates the analysis of historical climate change data and the evaluation of the probability of extreme events in different regions of the world. I hope that this package can be useful for researchers and decision makers working with uncertain data and complex weather phenomena.

I applied to the program because I deeply believe that science should be open and shared, and because I want to further strengthen my technical and community skills. I hope to learn about best practices in software development, package publishing, and also connect with a diverse network of people who believe in the power of collaborative knowledge.

## Mauro Loprete

{{< figure src = "/img/team/mauro-loprete.jpg" width = "250" alt = "Foto de perfil de Mauro Loprete" class = "pull-right" caption = "<strong>Mauro Loprete </br> UDELAR-IESTA </br> </strong>">}}

I am Mauro Loprete, [I have a degree in Statistics from the Universidad de la República (UDELAR).](https://fcea.udelar.edu.uy/depto-met-cuant-ensenanza/licenciatura-en-estadistica.html) I am currently an assistant professor in courses on computational statistics, data science and machine learning with R. I live in Montevideo and I am dedicated both to teaching and to the development of open tools for data analysis.

As a rOpenSci's Champion, my project is the development of [metasurvey](https://metasurveyr.github.io/metasurvey/) an R package designed to facilitate reproducible analysis of surveys with complex sample designs. The package allows the creation of flexible and automated workflows for loading, processing and analyzing surveys over time, incorporating resampling and metaprogramming techniques. metasurvey was created as part of my undergraduate final project for my Bachelor's degree in Statistics.

I applied to the program because I want to strengthen my skills in package development and actively contribute to the R ecosystem from Uruguay. I hope to learn from the experience and guidance of the rOpenSci community, and also to share what I have learned with students and colleagues, fostering a culture of open science and collaboration at my university and in the region.

Furthermore, my participation in the program represents a pioneering step within my institution: I would be the first undergraduate student to develop an R package with public outreach and actively contribute to an international open source community. I hope that this experience will motivate other students and faculty to get involved in open source development and reproducible research practices.

## Monika Avila Marquez

{{< figure src = "/img/team/monika-avila-marquez.jpeg" width = "250" alt = "Foto de perfil de Monika Avila Marquez" class = "pull-left" caption = "<strong>Monika Avila Marquez </br> Universidad de Ginebra </br> </strong>">}}

I am an econometrician with a Ph.D. in Econometrics from the University of Geneva.

I specialize in the analysis of panel (longitudinal) data and in the use of machine learning techniques to estimate econometric models.

My research also focuses on model selection for mixed-effects models. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Statistics at the University of Geneva.

My project will be to develop a new R package that facilitates the selection of the best random effects cross-sectional model. This problem is common in areas such as education, health, and longitudinal studies, where random effects do not follow a simple hierarchy.

## Soledad Andrea Araya Orrego

{{< figure src = "/img/team/soledad-araya.jpeg" width = "250" alt = "Foto de perfil de Soledad Andrea Araya Orrego" class = "pull-right" caption = "<strong>Soledad Andrea Araya Orrego </br> Dirección de Estudios Sociales UC </br> </strong>">}}

My name is Soledad Araya, I studied Political Science, and for the last 3 years I have been working as Project Manager at the Direction of Social Studies of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (DESUC), where my work consists, mainly, in the coordination of quantitative studies. For this reason, I use R on a daily basis: from the development of samples for the application of face-to-face surveys, to the construction of databases and subsequent analysis of results. In addition, I work as a teacher of methodological leveling in the Institute of Political Science of the same institution.

One of the main reasons why I applied to the program is because I want to develop a personal project that was born from the need to have accessible, standardized and ordered data on the results of elections in Chile. I know that this program will provide me with the necessary tools to achieve this, and I hope that this project will also be useful for all those who are curious about this type of information. The R community always generates spaces for growth and learning, and I hope to make the most of it.
