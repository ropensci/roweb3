description: "Introducing Champions and Mentors - Ghozayel Elotteebi and Zebulun Arendsee"

*We designed the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) with a mentorship aspect. Mentoring plays a significant role in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees alike. In our program, each Champion has a mentor who accompanies them during their training and development of their project.*

*In this series of blog posts, we introduce you to the ten teams of this first cohort and what they will be working on in the program.*

Meet **Ghozayel Elotteebi** from Argentina and **Zebulun Arendsee** from United Kingdom!

Hi! I'm Zebulun Arendsee (Zeb) and hope to serve as a mentor in R package development. 

I am a bioinformatics scientist at Regeneron working on sequencing, annotation, and oligonucleotide therapeutics design. In the past, I studied influenza at the USDA as a postdoc and orphan genes at Iowa State University as a graduate student. I've published many packages in R, including a few on CRAN and rOpenSci. I also develop in Python where I maintain several packages on PyPI and Conda and have one accepted JOSS paper. Outside my scientific work, I write mostly in Haskell, where I am building the Morloc programming language. 

So that's me in a nutshell, I'm really excited about the Champion Program and am looking forward to helping where I can!


_We're excited to have both Pao and Adam be part of the Champions program and can't wait to see what this partnership yields. _
