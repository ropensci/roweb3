Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2023/01/20/ropensci-news-digest-january-2023).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### {targets} in Action Community Call

Tuesday, 31 January 2023 20:00 UTC / Tuesday, 31 January 2023 15:00 EST / Wednesday, 1st February 07:00 AEDT.

The [{targets}](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package is a pipeline tool for Statistics and data science in R. With {targets}, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. {targets} learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.

On this call Will, Eric and Joel will share their experience putting **{targets} into action**. Eric will share with us _Using {targets} with HPC_ and Joel will talk about _Using {targets} for bioinformatics pipelines_, then Will will demonstrate _Debugging {targets} pipelines_.

More info on the [event page](/commcalls/jan2023-targets/).

### Coworking

Join us for social coworking & office hours monthly on first Tuesdays! 
Hosted by Steffi LaZerte and various community hosts. 
Everyone welcome. 
No RSVP needed. 
Consult our [Events](/events) page to find your local time and how to join.

- Tuesday, Feb 7th, 9:00 Americas Pacific / 17:00 UTC](/events/coworking-2023-02/) "Setting up Continuous Integration" *Hosted by community host [Hugo Gruson](/author/hugo-gruson/) and [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/)*
    - Do some reading to learn about Continuous Integration; Setup Continuous Integration on one (or more) of your projects;
    - Talk to [Hugo](/author/hugo-gruson/) and discuss how Continuous Integration can simplify your development process and how to get set up.

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following  package recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [phruta](https://docs.ropensci.org/phruta), developed by Cristian Roman Palacios: The phruta R package is designed to simplify the basic phylogenetic pipeline. Specifically, all code is run within the same program and data from intermediate steps are saved in independent folders. Furthrmore, all code is run within the same environment which increases the reproducibility of your analysis. phruta retrieves gene sequences, combines newly downloaded and local gene sequences, and performs sequence alignments. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/458) by Anna Krystalli, Rayna Harris, and Frederick Boehm.
