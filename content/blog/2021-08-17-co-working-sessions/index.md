We're excited to announce that as a result of our [Label-athon experiments](/events/labelathon02/), we'll be hosting monthly social co-working sessions via Zoom, starting September 2021!

Co-working is a great way to be productive and reduce feelings of social isolation (especially important over the last year)!

These sessions will give you the opportunity to 

- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff
- Co-work independently on work related to R (and perhaps focus on work that often gets neglected)
- Get answers to your questions

We plan to host sessions on the first Tuesday of the month, alternating times to accommodate different parts of the world.

Our first co-working session will take place **[Tuesday September 7th 2021 9-11am Pacific](/events/coworking-2021-09/)**. 

## Format

We'll be following the format we developed during our experimental label-athons: 

1. We start with introductions, giving everyone a chance to socialize and network before getting down to business
2. We co-work for 25min either in a Quiet or Noisy rooms 
    - Mix and match as you like
    - 'Noisy' room is for chatting, socializing, discussing problems and asking questions
3. We have 5-min breaks with fun scavenger hunts to get you up and moving
4. Repeat! We'll do a total of 3x 25min co-working blocks each separated by a 5-min break
5. Wrap up, a chance to share what we did and say good bye


## Label-athon experiments

In case you missed it, as a follow up to the community call [Set Up Your Package to Foster a Community](commcalls/apr2021-pkg-community/), 
this past spring and summer we experimented with hosting four co-working 
[label-athon events](/events/labelathon02/) on Zoom. 

During these events, participants introduced themselves and shared what they wanted to work on. 
We had two Zoom rooms, a quiet work room and a 'noisy' chat room, where we could socialize, ask questions, or discuss our work.

In line with the theme of the community call, we encouraged participants to work on making their packages more contributor friendly, such as labelling issues to invite contributions, or creating road maps. 
However, this wasn't a requirement for participation and many people worked on other things such as general package development and organization, research and planning for future development, setting up personal GitHub READMEs and preparing useR! 2021 presentations. 

We set up a work-flow to identify rOpenSci packages with issues labelled "help wanted", so we can tweet anything that came out of the co-working events (we'd tweet non-rOpenSci packages too, but needed participants to let us know which ones they worked on).
