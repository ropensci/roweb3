[The NumFOCUS’s Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (“DISC”) Unconf](https://numfocus.github.io/disc-unconference-2025/) took place as a hybrid event in São Paulo, Brazil, from March 14 to 16, 2025. 
Our community manager, [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/), and rOpenSci Champions, [Andrea Gomez Vargas](/author/andrea-gomez-vargas/) and [Liz Hare](/author/liz-hare/), participated.
In this short post we report on our experience at and around the unconference.

Prior to the meeting in Sao Paulo, participants met online to get to know each other and present their ideas for projects. 
Ten projects were selected and then developed during the weekend.

During the event, rOpenSci members collaborated with other participants to exchange experiences, brainstorm solutions, and design practical resources that could be shared with the broader community. 
They worked on projects related to [open mentoring programs](https://numfocus.github.io/disc-unconference-2025-projects/en/creating_an_open_mentorship_initiative.html), leadership skill training, and [international research funding](https://numfocus.github.io/disc-unconference-2025-projects/en/navigating-funding-landscape.html).  

We also had the chance to hear about other projects that interest the rOpenSci community, like open science training for researchers in the Global South and [multilingual](/multilingual-publishing/) solutions for open science.    

This unconference provided a valuable space to discuss pressing issues related to open research, education, software, and science. 
It was inspiring to work alongside peers who are committed to building more inclusive and accessible systems.

This event also gave the opportunity to meet in person with other members of rOpenSci in Sao Paulo, in the picture below we can see [Francesca Palmeira](/francesca-belem-lopes-palmeira/) (rOpenSci Champions), [Andrea Gomez Vargas](/author/andrea-gomez-vargas/) (rOpenSci Champions), [Beatriz Milz](/author/beatriz-milz/) (rOpenSci Editor and Mentor), [Haydee Svab](/author/haydee-svab/) (rOpenSci Champions) and Yanina Bellini Saibene (rOpenSci Community Manager).

We discussed our [translation](/multilingual-publishing/) effort and catch up on the [champions](/champions)' work after the program and in our [new champion program cohort](/blog/2025/03/10/champeons-latin-america/).
