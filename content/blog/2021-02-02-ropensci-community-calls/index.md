preface: "In December 2020, Stefanie Butland, rOpenSci’s Community Manager, gave a presentation and Q & A session on community calls for Code for Science & Society Event Fund grantees and fiscally-sponsored project leaders. Emily Lescak, CS&S Event Fund Manager, led the discussion. This post is adapted from the original at GET LINK https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/blog/URL."

rOpenSci community calls are online events in which information is shared with the goals of reinforcing our mission and values, informing people on technical and social topics, bringing different stakeholders’s perspectives to light, and identifying unmet needs on a topic. Our calls can include one to six speakers, or a moderated panel discussion. They run for an hour and consist of 40 minutes of presentation and 20 minutes for questions from the audience. **Strong social facilitation at every step is our key to success**. 

In this post, we’ll review the flow of community call development, from deciding on a topic to capturing the outcomes. Many of the same principles apply, whether the event is called a community call, panel discussion, or similar. Our goal is to share how we do it so you might adapt some elements to meet your needs.

## Choosing a topic

Typically, I solicit ideas from the rOpenSci team and community. It’s best to keep the topic focused rather than trying to cover too much. Recently I've experimented with crowdsourcing ideas in a transparent way via [GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls/issues). This has resulted in some rich public discussions that help focus and prioritize topics. You’re welcome to adapt this approach for your own needs; please acknowledge rOpenSci if you do.

To prioritize topics for the 2021 season, I pitched them to my colleagues and asked them to vote for their top five, using emojis on Slack.

## Selecting and preparing speakers

Depending on the topic, it may make sense to invite a single speaker. More often, several short presentations or a panel discussion is more appropriate, bearing in mind that organizing regular events with multiple speakers is time consuming! The open topic discussions on GitHub can reveal potential speakers or people whom I might ask to suggest others who are not “the usual suspects”. 

I start planning calls about two months in advance so that I can find a time that works for the presenters. I use a [scheduling tool](https://lettucemeet.com) to narrow down a date and time. When scheduling, keep time zones in mind! Think about where your target audience is largely located and whether the time is welcoming for them to attend. 

I schedule a one-hour pre-event meeting with speakers to introduce them to each other, have them share what they’re considering talking about, help them understand their audience, ask them what questions they think should be raised, and cover logistical details of the event. While the panelists are experts in their respective areas, they are not necessarily experienced in communicating with this particular community. I've found that these pre-event sessions lead to meaningful conversations that allow panelists to maximize their complementarity and give a sense of a comfortable discussion during the event. I think this may actually end up minimizing their preparation time. 

## Promoting the event 

Our  community calls are advertised on our [website](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/), Twitter, and relevant Slack groups and mailing lists. With many people finding increased constraints on their time and more virtual events to choose from, I emphasize the specific value of each community call and what makes their content and style unique. Successful promotion benefits immensely from overlap between members of different communities and their interests.

{{< figure src = "commcalls-promotion-shadow.png" class = "center" width = "600" caption = "Example promotional elements include speaker bios on the [landing page for the Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/dec2020-datarepos/) and a  [tweet](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci/status/1329092004496748545) that others can share" alt = "On left, a screenshot of 5 speaker bios with headshot and text for each. On right, screenshot of a [tweet](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci/status/1329092004496748545) tagging those speakers in promotion of the community call" >}}

## Running the event

It is important to begin with a script consisting of introducing your organization, code of conduct, Zoom etiquette, norms for asking questions, and introductions to the speakers. Attendees are encouraged to add their questions and take notes in a collaborative [doc](http://bit.ly/ropensci-commcall-maintaining). This results in clear and concise questions and can help lower barriers to participation. During Q&A, people are invited to unmute to ask their question, or the moderator can ask on their behalf. 

We typically get 40-50 attendees, sometimes 90, and recently had over 150. It's important to think beyond numbers of attendees; even if there is a lower turnout, those in attendance are likely gaining a lot from the discussion. For example, our community call on [involving multilingual communities](/commcalls/2019-06-28/) had low attendance, but led directly to our experiment with doing [software peer review in Spanish](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/414).

## Capturing outcomes and impact

The [archive page](/commcalls/2020-03-18/) for each community call includes the video with subtitles, links to speakers’ slides, the collaborative notes doc, and resources on the topic. They are sometimes summarized on rOpenSci’s blog. To encourage participation from community members, she has invited attendees to co-author a [blog post](/blog/2020/07/14/commcall-maintaining-pkg/) with a staff member. Don’t underestimate the value of sharing your impact success stories or anecdotes with your team and your community!

## Artifacts of a community call
Things that are created and archived for future reference:

*   [Landing page](/commcalls/dec2020-datarepos/) with all the things;
*   [Public discussion](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls/issues/9) that informed developing the topic and choosing speakers;
*   [Videos](https://vimeo.com/ropensci) of all past calls;
*   [Collaborative notes](http://bit.ly/ropensci-commcall-datarepos);
*   [Summary blog post](/blog/2020/07/14/commcall-maintaining-pkg/) example.

## Conclusion and Resources

It takes a lot of time to plan community calls well! However, the work can be dialed back. For example, not every call needs to have a summary blog post. If you’re new to organizing community calls, keep them simple! To streamline the effort of organizing a community call from start to finish, Stefanie works from a checklist and takes detailed planning notes.

Community calls are a great low-barrier way for new people to be exposed to your project and for you to hear what people are thinking about a topic. Here are some resources to support your community calls:
