Our first cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program finished the first phase of their training. In this article, we share the curriculum created for the champions, mentors, and applicants
and what we learned in this pilot.

## Training for the Champions

We planned a six-week training that covered the following topics:

* how to plan and facilitate engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success,
* knowledge of various channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and
* technical skills in software development and review.

The final curriculum for this pilot consisted of 5 courses:

### Making a PACT for engaging virtual meetings and events

In this 90-minute mini-workshop hosted by the [Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement](https://www.cscce.org/),
participants explore designing and facilitating engaging and productive virtual meetings and events.

Participants discuss the opportunities and challenges of working together online and outline the “Making a PACT” framework for effective meeting design. In addition to examples of the framework in action, attendees can apply it directly to some example scenarios so that participants feel empowered to use the framework in their own work.
Participants are welcome to review the CSCCE’s free guidebook on Zenodo ahead of the session: [A guide to using virtual events to facilitation community building: Making a PACT for more engaging virtual meetings and events](https://zenodo.org/record/4987666#.Y-1Y4nbMK5c)

All champions must complete this training.

### Package Development: The Mechanics

In this two-hour session with a live demo, a rOpenSci trainer demystifies the creation of an R package. R packages are mostly well-organized folders, with automatic tools to help, such as usethis. This workshop is for R users who have not previously developed or contributed to packages.

This training was developed for the Champion Program and taught by [Maëlle Salmon](/author/maëlle-salmon/).  It is intended for champions planning to develop a package without experience in this task.

### Package Development: Not Rocket Science

This two-hour workshop is for R users who’ve already developed or contributed to packages.
Ideally, participants attend with a package of their own to use as a playground.

This training was developed for the Champion Program and taught by [Maëlle Salmon](/author/maëlle-salmon/).  It is intended for champions planning to develop a package or send it to review and want to learn several tips and tricks on package development.

### How rOpenSci Performs Peer Review

This one-hour workshop is for people wanting to try the rOpenSci review process. We will go through The way we communicate and build and review software. We will check selected examples and resources and then have some time for Questions and comments.

This training was developed for the Champion Program and taught by [Mauro Lepore](/author/mauro-lepore/). This training is for champions who will send a package to review or become reviewers.

### How to contribute to base R

This workshop is a 60-minute walkthrough of how to contribute to base R. The outline includes How we can contribute to a bug, confirm a bug, diagnose a bug, and propose a fix to code/documentation.  

The workshop shows tools and strategies to find a bug to work on and what features make it good for first-timer to work on. It has examples and exercises on how to triage bugs.  Then show how to debug code/documentation with collaborative hand on. Next, show how to fix a bug by commenting on Bugzilla and a demo on creating a patch with git workflow. Finally, share pointers to further help and resources.

This training was developed for the Champion Program, taught by [Hether Turner](/author/heather-turner/), and is open to all champions and mentors.

## Trainning for the Mentors
Mentors gain mentoring skills during this training and orientation (active listening, effective questioning, and giving feedback). They receive resources for their mentoring roles, such as the Mentors Guidelines, Meeting Templates, and details of the logistics of the champions program.

This training was developed for the Champion Program, taught by [Yani Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/), and all mentors must complete it.

## Training for non-selected applicants

We also conduct workshops for those not selected to be champions. The aim of this workshops is to provide an opportunity for all applicants to develop skills in open-source software development for supporting career opportunities as well as future applications to this or other similar programs.

### Developing Software Together  

It is a three-hour course on using Git and GitHub to collaboratively develop open-source software with the R language. The workshop presents how to work with Git, using the command line, RStudio, and GitHub. Introduce the concept of version control systems, local and remote repositories, and actions like stage, commit, push, pull, and merge.  Also, show how to collaborate with others through forks and pull requests. The workshop has hands-on and group exercises.

The training was developed by Paola Corrales and taught by Paola and Yanina Bellini Saibene. 


## What do our participants think of the training received?

At the end of each workshop, we asked those who participated to fill out an anonymous survey telling us three things: 
* What did you like the most?
* What did you like the least? 
* Can you rate this meeting? (in a scale from 1-worst to 5-best). 

We use this feedback to improve the next sesion of the training. The result show the average score for all the training is 4.6. which let us know that the attendees are satisfied with the workshops.
