Our first cohort of the Champions program finished the first phase of their training, 
in this article we share the curriculum created for the champions, mentors, and applicants 
and what we learned in this pilot. 

## Training for the Champions

We planned a six-week training that covered the following topics:

* how to plan and facilitate engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success,
* knowledge of various channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and
* technical skills in software development and review.

The final curriculum for this pilot consisted of 5 courses:

### Making a PACT for engaging virtual meetings and events 

In this 90-minute mini-workshop hosted by the [Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement](https://www.cscce.org/), 
participants explore how to design and facilitate engaging and productive virtual meetings and events. 
Participants discuss the opportunities and challenges of working together online and outline the “Making a PACT” 
framework for effective meeting design. In addition to examples of the framework in action, 
attendees have an opportunity to apply it directly to some example scenarios so that participants 
leave feeling empowered to use the framework in their own work. 

Participants are welcome to review the CSCCE’s free guidebook on Zenodo ahead of the session: 
[A guide to using virtual events to facilitation community building: Making a PACT for more engaging virtual meetings and events](https://zenodo.org/record/4987666#.Y-1Y4nbMK5c)

All champions must complete this training.

### Package Development: The Mechanics 

In this two-hour session with a live demo an rOpenSci trainer demystifies the creation of an R package. 
R packages are mostly well-organized folders, and there are automatic tools to help such as usethis. 
This workshop is for R users who have not previously developed or contributed to packages. 

This training was developed for the Champion Program and taught by Maëlle Salmon.  It is intended for champions 
who are planning to develop a package and have no experience in this task.

### Package Development: Not Rocket Science

This two-hour workshop is for R users who’ve already developed or contributed to packages. 
Ideally, participants attend with a package of their own to use as a playground.

This training was developed for the Champion Program and taught by Maëlle Salmon.  It is intended for champions 
who are planning to develop a package or send a package to review and want to learn several tips and tricks on
package development. 

### How rOpenSci Performs Peer Review

This one-hour workshop is for people who might want to try rOpenSci review process. We will go through 
The way we communicate, The way we build and review software. We will check selected examples, resources 
and then some time for Questions and comments.

This training is for champions that will send a package to review or will become reviewers.
