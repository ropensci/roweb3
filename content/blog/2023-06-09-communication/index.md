description: "Communication channels announcement. rOpenSci stop interacting on Twitter."
---

As [we anticipated in November 2022](/en/blog/2022/11/16/mastodon-en) the changes implemented by Twitter have generated a less safe and friendly space for our community.  That is why from _June 2023_, we will stop interacting on this platform. We will maintain the account in hopes that we can return when Twitter is once again a safe and supportive space, but in the meanwhile will focus our communication efforts elsewhere.

We understand that until now Twitter has been one of the reference platforms for the R community, data, research and open science community but we have to be responsible and 
coherent with the spaces we choose for exchange and interaction and [our values as a community](/en/code-of-conduct/) and [organization](/about/).

We have been working to offer other meeting points that allow us to work in a _welcoming and diverse community_.  
The building and consolidation of these spaces, take time and need the collaboration of the whole community to make them grow. 
That's why we share with you all rOpenSci's communication channels so that you can use the one that best suits your needs.

## Mastodon

[We joined Mastodon in November](https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci) along with a large number of friend communities and members of our community.
After exploring different instances, we selected one that is aligned with our mission and that allows us to communicate in several languages. We also [developed tools to share our content](/blog/2023/05/17/scheduling-mastodon/) there. 

## The rOpenSci Newsletter and Blog

[Our monthly newsletter](/news/) is a permanent update on the most important news and the development of our projects, you can subscribe to receive it in your email. 
In our blog you will find articles, technical notes, interviews and updates. 
You can read it on the web, receive a digest via the newsletter, or subscribe to our [RSS feed](/rbloggers/index.xml).

## Discussion forum 

Exchanges are always enriching for our work and it is in these spaces where new challenges and ideas arise. Join us in the [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/), and learn more about [how you can interact in this space](/blog/2022/01/11/ropensci-forum/). 

## Events

[Community calls](/commcalls/), our [coworking sessions](/events/) and our [participation in events and conferences](/talks/) are other spaces where you can interact with other community members and the rOpenSci team.  
Check our calendar (or read the newsletter) to find out when and where they are happening. 

In all of our spaces and communication channels, we are committed to ensuring safe, accessible, open, diverse and friendly spaces.  
Our [code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) applies to all of them.


So while things change, we hope you are able to continue to join us in new and fun online spaces, and that we can continue to support each other in on our journeys to open and reproducible science!

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions you can write us at write us at info@ropensci.org. Also, we'd love to hear of other channels you might suggest we explore.
