We are pleased to open the call for the second cohort of **Champions and Mentors** for the rOpenSci Champions Program ðŸŽ‰ ! This program will continue to support our goal of identifying, recognizing, and rewarding passionate community members who help the community grow and improve.

The Champions Program [is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/), which means that it needs to be sustainable and open, and built __by and for all groups.__

We strive to drive meaningful change in the Open Science ecosystem and the R Community in particular, and for that  we recognize the need to support a diverse cohort of community leaders and contributors to all aspects of research software creation through our Champions Program.
That is why this program focuses on __people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded__ from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and research software communities.

We are looking for people that work in STEAM fields, from anywhere in the world, who already have development knowledge and experience with the R language. 


## What is expected of a Champion?

We have developed a **12-month-long program including cohort-based training, project development, and personal mentorship**. 

Champions will participate in a 6-week long cohort-based training on a) planning and facilitating engaging and inclusive workshops to support participantsâ€™ success, b) knowledge of various channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and c) technical skills in software development and review. 

After training, Champions will develop their project, which can be one of these options: 

- create a new package, 
- go through the review process with an R package they have already developed, 
- or be a reviewer for our peer review system.  

Other Champions activities include options for delivering a talk, writing blog posts and teaching other community members. During this stage, Champions will receive personal and group mentorship through meetings with mentors, quarterly cohort calls, Community Manager support, and a dedicated channel on rOpenSci Slack workspace.

We will provide a $1000 (USD) stipend to the selected community Champions after they complete the program.
We are looking for **six to nine** Champions for this second cohort. We expect to co-create this iteration of the rOpenSci Champions Program with the selected applicants and to refine future editions with their experience and feedback.

We look forward to receiving many applications and are committed to directing non-selected applicants towards other ways in which they can develop skills and contribute to rOpenSci.


## What is expected of a Mentor?

Mentors will play a vital role in the rOpenSci Champions Program by helping select the Champions and advising and inspiring their mentees. Mentors will also connect their mentees to people, programs, and organizations; recommend resources, readings, training, and experiences; and provide feedback on the menteeâ€™s project.

We are seeking mentors from the rOpenSci community who have:

  * Demonstrated an understanding and ability to work openly and collaboratively;

  * The willingness to guide and teach others;

  * Previous experience with any of the following:

      * Developing, maintaining or contributing to any rOpenSci package or package which has gone through rOpenSci review, or

      * Participating in the rOpenSci review process, or

      * Package development and/or peer code review.

Mentors will gain mentoring experience and skills, be acknowledged on the rOpenSci website and social media channels, and make new connections across the Championsâ€™ networks. By mentoring our selected Champions and helping to shape this program mentors will also be giving back to the rOpenSci community in a great and meaningful way!
