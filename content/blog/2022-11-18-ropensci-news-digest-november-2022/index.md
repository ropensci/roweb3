Dear rOpenSci friends, it’s time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/11/18/ropensci-news-digest-november-2022).
Now let’s dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Multilingual Publishing

Open Source and Open Science are global movements, but most of their material and resources are published in English.
Non-English speakers face a significant barrier to being part of these movements.  
Publishing multilingual resources can lower the barrier to access to knowledge, help democratize access to quality resources and increase the possibilities of contributing to software and open science projects.

With the the support of the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/) and [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) we start to translate rOpenSci’s material on best practices for software development, code review, and contribution to open source projects beyond the English language.
As part of this effort we are also developping guidelines for translating open source resources to a wider audience.

[Learn more about this project](/multilingual-publishing/) on our webpage.

### Champions Program

The application period for our champions program is now closed.

We are very excited about the response from the community: we received 74 applications for champions and 28 for mentors from 31 countries.

We are very grateful to those who took the time to apply and all those who helped us spread the word about these calls.

Over the next few weeks, we will review the proposals and select the nominees. All applicants will receive feedback on their applications.

You can learn more about it on the [program web page](/champions/).

{{< figure src="map.png" alt="World Maps with the applicant's countries colored. The map shows America almost all painted and then some few countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and Oceania.">}}

### Past community Call on Mentoring & training program for Scientific Open Source Champions

We relaunched our community calls with an edition dedicated to our champions program.  
In order to learn more about what it is to be a champion, why apply to these programs, how it can benefit not only us, but also our communities, we invited champions from other spaces and communities to share their experiences, tips and learnings.

On this call Santosh Yadav and Emanuele Bartolesi moderated by Yani Bellini Saibene shared their experience of being champions in their communities and give advice on how to create a path to become a champion in open source software communities.

You can [watch the video](/commcalls/oct2022-champions/) and [access all the materials](/commcalls/oct2022-champions/) on our website.

## Software :package:

### New packages

The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite:

-   [daiquiri](https://docs.ropensci.org/daiquiri), developed by T. Phuong Quan: Generate reports that enable quick visual review of temporal shifts in record-level data. Time series plots showing aggregated values are automatically created for each data field (column) depending on its contents (e.g. min/max/mean values for numeric data, no. of distinct values for categorical data), as well as overviews for missing values, non-conformant values, and duplicated rows. The resulting reports are shareable and can contribute to forming a transparent record of the entire analysis process. It is designed with Electronic Health Records in mind, but can be used for any type of record-level temporal data (i.e. tabular data where each row represents a single “event”, one column contains the “event date”, and other columns contain any associated values for the event). It is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=daiquiri).

-   [npi](https://docs.ropensci.org/npi), developed by Frank Farach: Access the United States National Provider Identifier Registry API (if available) and provide informative error messages when it’s not. Obtain rich administrative data linked to a specific individual or organizational healthcare provider, or perform advanced searches based on provider name, location, type of service, credentials, and many other attributes. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/505) by Matthias Grenié, and Emily C. Zabor.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Tired of typing \#’ before function examples?

You can write your [function examples](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/01/27/examples) in separate scripts and then refer to them using the [roxygen2 `@example` (no s!) tag](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#examples).

You’d write

``` r
#' @example man/examples/foo.R
```

and in `man/examples/foo.R`

``` r
# basic usage of foo
foo(basic = TRUE)
# elaborate usage of foo
foo(basic = FALSE)
```

Downsides of using this are that it might surprise contributors, and that someone who’d look for the source of the example through, say, the link indicated on a pkgdown reference page, would not get to the example source directly.

Thanks to Hugo Gruson for reminding this in the [rOpenSci semi-open slack](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels).

### Display a message or warning only once per session?

If that’s your need, know that [`rlang::warn()` and `rlang::inform()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/abort.html) have a handy `.frequency` argument, as reported by [Jon Harmon on Posit Community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-print-a-once-only-package-startup-message/151468/3).

### Run some tests on continuous integration only?

Say you have some slow and fragile tests querying an API.
If you want to run them on continuous integration only,
refer to [Bryce Mecum’s blog post](https://brycemecum.com/2020/08/05/testing-r-api-packages/).

### How to use additional packages for the pkgdown website only

Say a package is needed for a pkgdown article of your package (but not a vignette), or for nicer autolinking of a reference to a function (for instance if you recommend `usethis::create_package()`).
Assuming you’re building your website with GitHub Actions from [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples) (that you might have gotten via [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github_actions.html)).

If so, you can use the `Config/Needs/website` field in `DESCRIPTION`.
Here is an example, in [pkgdown itself](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/blob/7fe9e802df2964d483d0267f1d5a59aa7b3c685d/DESCRIPTION#L64)

    Config/Needs/website: usethis, servr

The idea of custom fields is mentioned in the second edition of the [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/Metadata.html#custom-fields).

Note that it works for rOpenSci packages, whose documentation websites are [built with R-universe](/blog/2021/09/03/runiverse-docs/)!
