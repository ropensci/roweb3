Dear rOpenSci friends, it‚Äôs time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/11/18/ropensci-news-digest-november-2022).
Now let‚Äôs dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Multilingual Publishing

Open Source and Open Science are global movements, but most of their material and resources are published in English, meaning non-English speakers face a significant barrier to being part of these movements.  
Publishing multilingual resources can lower these barriers by increasing access to knowledge, which helps democratize access to quality resources, and therefore increases the potential for contributing to software and open science projects.

We‚Äôre excited to announce that with the support of the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/), [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) and the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/), we have started translating rOpenSci‚Äôs material on best practices for software development, code review, and contribution to open source projects into Spanish.
As part of this effort we are also developing guidelines for translating open source resources to a wider audience.

Learn more about our [Multilingual Publishing project](/multilingual-publishing/).

### Champions Program

The application period for our champions program is now closed.

We are very excited about the response from the community! We received 74 applications for Champions and 28 for mentors from 31 countries.

We are very grateful to those who took the time to apply and to all who helped us spread the word about these calls.

Over the next few weeks, we will review the proposals and select the nominees. All applicants will receive feedback on their applications.

Learn more about our [Champions Program](/champions/).

### Coworking sessions continue!

Join us for social coworking & office hours monthly on first Tuesdays!
Hosted by Steffi LaZerte and various community hosts.
Everyone welcome.
No RSVP needed.
Consult our [Events](/events) page to find your local time and how to join.

- [Tuesday, December 6th, 9:00 Australian Western / 1:00 UTC](/events/coworking-2022-12/) ‚ÄúGetting started with targets!‚Äù *Hosted by community host [Nick Tierney](/author/nicholas-tierney/) and [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/)*
  - Dive into the world of targets! Do some studying; Start setting it up for some of your projects;
  - Ask [Nick](/author/nicholas-tierney/) for suggestions how how to get started or tips and tricks.

  - Talk to [Hugo](/author/hugo-gruson/) and discuss how Continuous Integration can simplify your development process and how to get set up.

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!

## Software :package:

### New packages

The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite:

- [daiquiri](https://docs.ropensci.org/daiquiri), developed by T. Phuong Quan: Generate reports that enable quick visual review of temporal shifts in record-level data. Time series plots showing aggregated values are automatically created for each data field (column) depending on its contents (e.g.¬†min/max/mean values for numeric data, no. of distinct values for categorical data), as well as overviews for missing values, non-conformant values, and duplicated rows. The resulting reports are shareable and can contribute to forming a transparent record of the entire analysis process. It is designed with Electronic Health Records in mind, but can be used for any type of record-level temporal data (i.e.¬†tabular data where each row represents a single ‚Äúevent‚Äù, one column contains the ‚Äúevent date‚Äù, and other columns contain any associated values for the event). It is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=daiquiri). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/535) by Brad Cannell, and Mauro Lepore.

- [npi](https://docs.ropensci.org/npi), developed by Frank Farach: Access the United States National Provider Identifier Registry API <https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/>. Obtain and transform administrative data linked to a specific individual or organizational healthcare provider, or perform advanced searches based on provider name, location, type of service, credentials, and other attributes exposed by the API. It is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=npi). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/505) by Matthias Greni√©, and Emily C. Zabor.

## Call for package (co-)maintainers

### Call for maintainers

There are still a few packages to adopt [from our recent blog post](/blog/2022/10/17/maintain-or-co-maintain-an-ropensci-package/). To volunteer, comment in the corresponding volunteering issue. Thank you!

- **wikitaxa, Taxonomic Information from ‚ÄòWikipedia‚Äô**. ‚ÄòTaxonomic‚Äô information from ‚ÄòWikipedia‚Äô, ‚ÄòWikicommons‚Äô, ‚ÄòWikispecies‚Äô, and ‚ÄòWikidata‚Äô. Functions included for getting taxonomic information from each of the sources just listed, as well performing taxonomic search. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci/wikitaxa/issues/20).
- **rgnparser, Parse Scientific Names**. Parse scientific names using [‚Äògnparser‚Äô](https://github.com/gnames/gnparser), written in Go. ‚Äògnparser‚Äô parses scientific names into their component parts; it utilizes a Parsing Expression Grammar specifically for scientific names.

[Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/issues/292).
- **Rclean, A Tool for Writing Cleaner, More Transparent Code**. To create clearer, more concise code provides this toolbox helps coders to isolate the essential parts of a script that produces a chosen result, such as an object, tables and figures written to disk. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci/Rclean/issues/213).

### Call for comaintainers

Refer to our [recent blog post](/blog/2022/10/17/maintain-or-co-maintain-an-ropensci-package/#packages-looking-for-co-maintainers) to identify packages where help is especially wished for!

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Tired of typing \#‚Äô before function examples?

You can write your [function examples](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/01/27/examples) in separate scripts and then refer to them using the [roxygen2 `@example` (no s!) tag](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#examples).

You‚Äôd write

``` r
#' @example man/examples/foo.R
```

and in `man/examples/foo.R`

``` r
# basic usage of foo
foo(basic = TRUE)
# elaborate usage of foo
foo(basic = FALSE)
```

Downsides of using this are that it might surprise contributors, and that someone who‚Äôd look for the source of the example through, say, the link indicated on a pkgdown reference page, would not get to the example source directly.

Thanks to Hugo Gruson for reminding this in the [rOpenSci semi-open slack](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels).

### Display a message or warning only once per session?

If that‚Äôs your need, know that [`rlang::warn()` and `rlang::inform()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/abort.html) have a handy `.frequency` argument, as reported by [Jon Harmon on Posit Community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-print-a-once-only-package-startup-message/151468/3).

### Run some tests on continuous integration only?

Say you have some slow and fragile [tests querying an API](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/).
If you want to run them on continuous integration only,
refer to [Bryce Mecum‚Äôs blog post](https://brycemecum.com/2020/08/05/testing-r-api-packages/).

### How to use additional packages for the pkgdown website only

Say a package is needed for a pkgdown article of your package (but not a vignette), or for nicer autolinking of a reference to a function (for instance if you recommend `usethis::create_package()`).
Assuming you‚Äôre building your website with GitHub Actions from [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples) (that you might have gotten via [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github_actions.html)).

If so, you can use the `Config/Needs/website` field in `DESCRIPTION`.
Here is an example, in [pkgdown itself](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/blob/7fe9e802df2964d483d0267f1d5a59aa7b3c685d/DESCRIPTION#L64)

    Config/Needs/website: usethis, servr

The idea of custom fields is mentioned in the second edition of the [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/Metadata.html#custom-fields).

Note that it works for rOpenSci packages, whose documentation websites are [built with R-universe](/blog/2021/09/03/runiverse-docs/)!
