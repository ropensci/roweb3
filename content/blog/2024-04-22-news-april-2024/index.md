### R-Universe documentation gets a boost from Google Season of Docs

We are excited and grateful to [announce](/blog/2024/04/12/gsod-announcement/) that [R-Universe](https://r-universe.dev/) has been awarded a [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) grant. R-Universe is rOpenSci‚Äôs platform for testing, building, distributing, and discovering R packages, led by [Jeroen Ooms](/author/jeroen-ooms/).

With the support of Google, we aim to update and centralize our documentation, showcasing how users and developers can get the most out of R-Universe. We will update the documentation to catch up with the rapid feature development of the past two years, including consolidating our many tech notes and READMEs into an easily discoverable site. We will build the site with Quarto to make it straightforward for R community members to contribute.

The work will be led by [Ma√´lle Salmon](/author/ma√´lle-salmon/).

### Learn about a different package every day by following our social media campaigns 


The goal of a community is to collaborate, share knowledge and build learnings.  That's why we want to show you the more than 300 packages in our federated community of open-source software developers. 

Since December 2023, we have run the social media campaigns [‚ÄúA Package a Day](https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/tagged/APackageADay) on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci), in which we feature one package each day. On [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ropensci/), we publish our [Package Weekly Digest](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=packageweeklydigest&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7170464303186108416) every Monday with a list of five packages that belong to the same category.

You can follow us and the hashtags #APackageADay and #PackageWeeklyDigest to stay informed about rOpenSci R packages and learn about them.


### Help us put together the rOpenSci Community Call calendar for the year!

We are organizing the Community Calls for this year. Could you help us decide which topics we should cover? 

We hold [Community Calls](/commcalls/) to share knowledge that is relevant to our community and consistent with [our vision and mission](/about/). These are free and open for anyone to attend and provide opportunities for us to connect with rOpenSci community members around the world.
We‚Äôve [opened an issue in this repository for each topic we‚Äôre considering](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc). We‚Äôd like your input and ‚Äúvotes‚Äù on these, and your suggestions for other topics we haven‚Äôt thought of.

We would love to hear your ideas. üôè 

## Software :package:


### New packages




The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite, or were recently reviewed again:

+ [baRulho](https://docs.ropensci.org/baRulho), developed by Marcelo Araya-Salas: Intended to facilitate acoustic analysis of (animal) sound transmission experiments, which typically aim to quantify changes in signal structure when transmitted in a given habitat by broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds at increasing distances. The package offers a workflow with functions to prepare the data set for analysis as well as to calculate and visualize several degradation metrics, including blur ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, excess attenuation and envelope correlation among others (Dabelsteen et al 1993 <https://doi.org/10.1121/1.406682>).  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=baRulho). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/609).

+ [fellingdater](https://docs.ropensci.org/fellingdater), developed by Kristof Haneca: fellingdater is an R package that aims to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of tree-ring data from wooden cultural heritage objects and structures. The package standardizes the process of computing and combining felling date estimates, both for individual and groups of related tree-ring series. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/618) by Antonio Jesus P√©rez-Luque and Nicholas John Tierney.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### R-hub version 2!

G√°bor Cs√°rdi announced the [second version of R-hub](https://blog.r-hub.io/2024/04/11/rhub2/), for checking your R package, either on GitHub Actions or in an ad-hoc basis, using the rhub2 package.

### Patterns and anti-patterns of data analysis reuse

Miles McBain wrote an [insightful blog](https://www.milesmcbain.com/posts/data-analysis-reuse/) post advocating for creating a universe of related packages to support data analyses at your organization, contrasting this approach with other approaches such as copy-pasting or having a single gigantic package.

### Install several R versions at once with rig

As reminded by [Jenny Bryan on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jennybryan@fosstodon.org/112176595542760673), rig, the [R Installation Manager](https://github.com/r-lib/rig#readme) maintained by G√°bor Cs√°rdi, is a fantastic tool for being able to experiment locally with different R versions, especially when developing or debugging your R packages.

### Update on mocking for testing R packages

Mocking is the "art of replacing a function with whatever fake we need for testing", a nice tool to add to your toolbox. 
Read the [R-hub blog post](https://blog.r-hub.io/2024/03/21/mocking-new-take/).

### Be careful when using git clean

Athanasia Mo Mowinckel shared her recent [Git mishap](https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2024/2024/git-clean-woes/) in a helpful post that also includes tips and resources.

### Notes on refactoring an API client

[Scott Chamberlain](/author/scott-chamberlain/) published some [notes about refactoring an API client](https://recology.info/2024/03/refactoring-notes/), including some arguments in favor of "separation of concerns and code".

### Slides on good functions

Nick Tierney posted his useful [slidedeck "Practical Functions: Practically Magic"](https://github.com/njtierney/funfun).
