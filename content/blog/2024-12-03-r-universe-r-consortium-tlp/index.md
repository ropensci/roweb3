We are excited to announce that [R-Universe](/r-universe/)
has been [named](https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-universe-named-r-consortiums-newest-top-level-project/) the [R Consortium's](https://r-consortium.org) newest [Top-Level Project](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/)!  We're glad
to be in the company of community and infrastructure projects that have been
designated critical to the R Ecosystem, such as [R-hub](https://blog.r-hub.io/), [DBI](https://r-dbi.org/), [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), and the
[R User Group program](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/isc-working-groups.html), and we are grateful for the support of the R Consortium and
its [Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC)](https://r-consortium.org/about/governance#infrastructure-steering-committee)

The R Consortium supports the R community to help develop the infrastructure
required to ensure the long-term stability and growth of the R Ecosystem. They
have generously supported R-Universe for the past year. Now, in
granting R-Universe top-level status, the R Consortium has committed to support
us for three more years. This endorsement and investment will help us meet our goal 
of making R-Universe a sustainable and scalable platform for R package
development that individuals and organizations can rely on. Jeroen Ooms,
R-Universe's lead developer, will also join the R-Consortium's Infrastructure
Steering Committee. We are glad to play a part in helping support important
R community projects in the future!

R-Universe is rOpenSci’s platform for improving publication and discovery of research software in R.
It serves as a **global catalog** of software, articles, and data found
across R repositories.  It is a **software publication platform** providing a fully
automated pipeline for testing, building, and publishing R packages. It is also
a **meta-repository**, providing common infrastructure for both individuals and
organizations to manage custom R package repositories using their own approach
to curation, release management, and quality control.

R-Universe already serves tens of thousands of packages published by over a thousand
organizations, and we are excited for what's ahead. This year, our aim is to improve features which serve groups that
are building large-scale, collaborative repositories using R-Universe's platform
and API, like the new [R-Multiverse](https://r-multiverse.org/). This includes
support for things like development and production branches of universes, custom
package checks, and manual approval steps so universe owners can curate and govern
package collections as they see fit.
We also plan to expand our contributor base through more documentation and
partner outreach, and to improve performance and reliability as we continue to
grow. We look forward to working with the R Community on making R-Universe a
first-class home for R software.
