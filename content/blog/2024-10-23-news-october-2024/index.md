Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2024/10/23/news-october-2024).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Fostering open science in Latin America: CZI awards funds for sustainable research software development

Exciting News! 
The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has awarded rOpenSci a new grant to foster sustainable scientific software as a pillar of Open Science in Latin America by building capacity and community. 
With this $340K grant, we’re planning to launch a Spanish-language version of our Champions Program, along with other new initiatives to make sustainable software development more accessible to researchers across the region. 
Read more in our [announcement](/blog/2024/10/10/czi-latam-grant/).

### R-Universe interactive tour

Each package page on R-universe now features a guided tour built with intro.js, so that you might get an overview of all information presented on package pages.
To start the tour, click on the "Website Tour" button on the navbar -- note that it does not work on mobile devices.
Example: [xml2 package](https://r-lib.r-universe.dev/xml2).

### rOpenSci at UK Research Software Engineers conference

The eighth annual [UK Research Software Engineering conference](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) took place in Newcastle from September 3rd to 5th.
[Mark Padgham](/author/mark-padgham) presented a talk  on "*rOpenSci statistical software peer-review: The importance and challenge of community engagement*".
The talk was second in a two-part session devoted to software peer review, and followed a [walk-through demonstration of the process of submissing to Journal of Open Source software](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/event/49081/submission/69).
Find [Mark's slides](https://mpadge.github.io/presentations/2024/rseconf/).

### Our first community call in Portuguese!

**[A comunidade R fala português](/commcalls/translation-portuguese/)**
🕓 Wednesday, 06 November 2024 13:00 UTC 
With [Pedro Faria](/author/pedro-faria/), [Beatriz Milz](/author/beatriz-milz/), [Francesca Belem Lopes Palmeira](/author/francesca-belem-lopes-palmeira/).

The R Community is carrying out several translations into Portuguese of different resources: books, packages and guides.  

In this community call, three leaders from the Portuguese-speaking community will present their experiences leading and being part of these projects and share how we can participate in these efforts, including rOpenSci Developer Guide translation project.

This community call will be followed by a [traslaton at LatinR](https://www.eventbrite.cl/e/traducao-hackathon-traslaton-ropensci-tickets-1045507530167), for those who want to contribute.

### Looking for Maintainers to Support First-Time Contributors

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following five packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [pkgmatch](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgmatch), developed by Mark Padgham: Find R packages matching either descriptions or other R packages. 

+ [rsi](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi), developed by Michael Mahoney: Downloads spatial data from spatiotemporal asset catalogs (STAC), computes standard spectral indices from the Awesome Spectral Indices project (Montero et al. (2023) <doi:10.1038/s41597-023-02096-0>) against raster data, and glues the outputs together into predictor bricks. Methods focus on interoperability with the broader spatial ecosystem; function arguments and outputs use classes from sf and terra, and data downloading functions support complex CQL2 queries using rstac.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsi). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/636) by Felipe Carvalho and Michael Sumner.

+ [allcontributors](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors), developed by Mark Padgham together with Chris Hartgerink: Acknowledge all contributors to a project via a single function call. The function appends to a README or other specified file(s) a table with names of all individuals who contributed via code or repository issues. The package also includes several additional functions to extract and quantify contributions to any repository.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=allcontributors). 

+ [chopin](https://docs.ropensci.org/chopin), developed by Insang Song together with Kyle Messier: Geospatial data computation is parallelized by grid, hierarchy, or raster files. Based on future and mirai parallel backends, terra and sf functions as well as convenience functions in the package can be distributed over multiple threads. The simplest way of parallelizing generic geospatial computation is to start from `par_pad_*` functions to `par_grid`, `par_hierarchy`, or `par_multirasters` functions. Virtually any functions accepting classes in terra or sf packages can be used in the three parallelization functions. A common raster-vector overlay operation is provided as a function `extract_at`, which uses exactextractr, with options for kernel weights for summarizing raster values at vector geometries. Other convenience functions for vector-vector operations including simple areal interpolation (`summarize_aw`) and summation of exponentially decaying weights (`summarize_sedc`) are also provided. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/638) by Alec L. Robitaille and Eric R. Scott.

+ [eDNAjoint](https://docs.ropensci.org/eDNAjoint), developed by Abigail G. Keller: Models integrate environmental DNA (eDNA) detection data and traditional survey data to jointly estimate species catch rate (see package vignette: <https://ednajoint.netlify.app/>). Models can be used with count data via traditional survey methods (i.e., trapping, electrofishing, visual) and replicated eDNA detection/nondetection data via polymerase chain reaction (i.e., PCR or qPCR) from multiple survey locations. Estimated parameters include probability of a false positive eDNA detection, a site-level covariates that scale the sensitivity of eDNA surveys relative to traditional surveys, and catchability coefficients for traditional gear types. Models are implemented with a Bayesian framework (Markov chain Monte Carlo) using the Stan probabilistic programming language.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eDNAjoint). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/642) by Chitra M. Saraswati and Saras M. Windecker.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Using property-based testing in R

Want to add more variation to your test cases?
Don't miss Etienne Bacher's post [Using property-based testing in R](https://www.etiennebacher.com/posts/2024-10-01-using-property-testing-in-r/) where he explains _"Property-based testing is a way of testing where we give random inputs to the function we want to test and we want to ensure that no matter the inputs, the output will respect some properties."_.
The post includes examples.

### Useful functions for comparing versions

If you need to compare versions in your code, for instance installed version and version at which a feature was added, these two functions might prove handy:

- `numeric_version()` from base R that, given a string representation of a version, creates an object you can for instance compare. [Example usage in the greta R package](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agreta-dev%2Fgreta%20numeric_version&type=code).
- `utils::compareVersion()` that compares string representations of versions. [Example usage in the targets R package](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/9843fbd6cb31d2d4936cd0d96f1c06da2831a2d1/R/utils_assert.R#L611).

### Create and use a custom roxygen2 tag

In a [blog post](https://masalmon.eu/2024/09/03/roxygen2-custom-tag/), Maëlle Salmon describes how to create and use a simple custom roxygen2 tag that adds a section to the Rd file.
