This was how being a newcomer to [rOpenSci OzUnconf 2019](https://ozunconf19.ropensci.org/) felt. It was incredible to be a part of such a diverse, welcoming and inclusive environment. I thought it would be fun to blog about how it all began, and the twists and turns we experienced along the way as we developed the [gghdr](https://sayani07.github.io/gghdr/) package. The package provides tools for plotting [highest density regions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684423?seq=1) with ggplot2 and was inspired by the package [hdrcde](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hdrcde/index.html) developed by [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/). The highest density region approach of summarizing a distribution is useful for analyzing multimodal distributions and can be composed of numerous disjoint subsets. For example, the histogram of the highway mileage (`hwy`) data from the mpg dataset (a) shows that cars with 6 cylinders (`cyl`) are bimodally distributed, which is reflected in the highest density region (HDR) boxplot (c) but not in the standard boxplot (b). Hence, we see that HDRs are useful in displaying multimodality in the distribution. 

{{<figure src="mpgBox1-1.png" alt="Three plots showing the distribution of hwy by value of cyl. The first plot shows histograms by cyl, the second boxplots by cyl and the third shows highest density region plots. These look like boxes with the edges fading to nothing.">}}


The other authors of this package include 
[Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild), [Stephen Pearce](https://github.com/sparce), [Ryo Nakagawara](https://github.com/Ryo-N7), [Darya Vanichkina](https://github.com/dvanic), [Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.org/), [Thomas Fung](https://github.com/thomas-fung) and [Rob J Hyndman](https://github.com/robjhyndman/).

# Initiation

<!-- Initially, the aim was to visualize _Highest Density Regions_ (HDR) in one and two dimensions under the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) framework.  -->

Since Rob's paper describing highest density regions was written almost 25 years ago and the package came 15 years ago, the need to reexamine it through the ggplot2 lenses had been lurking around for a while. While I read the paper and attempted using hdrcde, it did feel less powerful not being able to use ggplot2 and the flexibilities that come along with it. Rob himself suggested it would be great to have a ggplot2 framework. I tried it but didn't get a chance to put it all together. There was even a point where [Mitch O'Hara-Wild](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/) was threatening me that he would get this done overnight if I didnâ€™t (and I bet he would have had he not been raising chickens and bees)! But one fine day, he suggested that the rOpensci ozunconf could be the right place to do this together. I thought this was a brilliant idea as I had read about [Nick Tierney's](/author/nicholas-tierney/) [experience](/blog/2017/10/31/ozunconf2017/) earlier and was thrilled to be a part of it. 

This event is quite different from other conferences in the sense that it is mostly invite-only, where past attendees can recommend new ones. Mitch was a participant at [OzUnconf 2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/#about), so he could invite me to work on this project with him at ozunconf 2019. Soon I had applied and we were accepted. Thanks go to the organizers of the ozunconf for the opportunity and excellent management of what has turned out to be a highly stimulating experience. 

# Planning and execution

Shortly after we were accepted, Mitch posted the idea on the [rOpenSci Github issues page](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf19/issues). Posting an issue like this is a great place to start a discussion on a rough idea or to learn more or comment on any idea that you find exciting. We brainstormed for a couple of days on how [hdrcde](https://github.com/robjhyndman/hdrcde) worked and what potential functions and features we would like to have or improve in the new package. The discussion led to a workflow which pretty much looked like this: 


{{< figure src = "board.jpg" alt = "A white board with flow diagrams worked out in red marker. gghdr is in the centre with arrows leading to sections for confint, boxplot, bxplot2d, scatter and cde" >}}

Doing a bit of brainstorming on the project ahead of time helped us to set the expectations, and communicate them to potential team members. Although it is worth mentioning that projects don't need to be fully fleshed out ahead of time - the ozunconf organisers strongly encourage working on projects that you thought of even on that very day.

Fast-forward to the first day of the conference! The participants had already suggested ideas ([there were many brilliant ones](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf19/issues)) and then voting started for the projects people were excited to be associated with. Little did we know that time there would be more enthusiasts who would be as eager to contribute to this project and learn about ggplot2 internals (very aptly put by Mitch while advertising the project. Smart move mate)! Oh, and what a fun and collaborative team to work with!

At the end of the two days, we had established the following:

1. `geom_hdr_boxplot()` to replace `hdr.boxplot()` to calculate HDR boxplots in one dimension.

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">

__Before:__
```r 
library(hdrcde)
hdr.boxplot(faithful$eruptions, 
            prob = c(99, 95, 50),
            all.modes = FALSE) 
```
{{<figure src="hdrcde-boxplot-1.png" alt="A HDR boxplot of the variable eruptions from the faithful data set constructed through the hdrcde package. The plot shows the highest density region boxplots split into two disjoint boxes, with a global mode represented by a line in the first box. Each box has one or more shades corresponding to different HDR probability coverages. The boxes have three shades of gray, with the dark, medium, and light shades corresponding to 50%, 95%, and 99% probability coverage, respectively. ">}}

</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">

__After:__
```r 
library(gghdr)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(faithful, aes(y = eruptions)) +
  geom_hdr_boxplot(prob = c(0.5, 0.95, 0.99),
                   all.modes = FALSE) 
```
{{<figure src="gghdr-boxplot-1.png" alt="A HDR boxplot of the variable eruptions from the faithful data set constructed through the gghdr package. It appears identical to the previous plot, however any other geom may be readily added to this display using the ggplot2 framework.">}}
</div>
</div>

2. The interval bars in `hdr.den()` to be replaced with a rug plot to display HDRs of 1d marginal distributions in `geom_hdr_rug()`. `geom_density()` could then be added to the resultant plot to get plots equivalent to `hdr.den()`.
 
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">

__Before:__
```r 
library(hdrcde)
hdr.den(faithful$eruptions,
        col = c("skyblue", "slateblue2", "slateblue4"))
```
{{<figure src="hdrcde-den-1.png" alt="A density plot with the highest density regions constructed through the hdrcde package. The plot shows the density of the eruptions variable from the faithful data set and the highest density regions with different probability coverages are represented with horizontal bars at the bottom of the density plot. The ends of the bars are joined to the densities using dotted lines. Similar to HDR box plots, HDR density plots can be shown for different colors corresponding to different HDR probability coverages.">}}

```
#> $hdr
#>         [,1]     [,2]     [,3]     [,4]
#> 99% 1.325006 2.819318 3.150488 5.281301
#> 95% 1.501086 2.520411 3.499998 5.090902
#> 50% 1.922811 2.023740 3.946274 4.769700
#> 
#> $mode
#> [1] 4.379524
#> 
#> $falpha
#>         1%         5%        50% 
#> 0.06665753 0.15244145 0.36339705
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">

__After:__
```r 
library(gghdr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
hdrc_bw <- hdrcde::hdrbw(faithful$eruptions, mean(c(0.5, 0.95, 0.99)))
faithful %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eruptions)) +
  geom_density(n= 1001, bw = hdrc_bw) +
  geom_hdr_rug(fill=  "blue") + 
  xlim(c(0.6833018, 6.0166982))
```
{{<figure src="gghdr-den-1.png" alt="Density and HDR rug plots of the variable eruptions from the faithful data set constructed through the gghdr package. It appears identical to the previous plot, but any of the bars at the bottom are replaced by rug plots with local modes shown, and there are no dotted lines connecting the rugs and densities.">}}
</div>
</div>

Also, the display of 1d marginal distributions for both variables could be a useful feature to have through `geom_hdr_rug()`.

```r 
ggplot(faithful, aes(y = eruptions, x = waiting)) + 
  geom_hdr_rug(sides = "trbl", fill = "blue") + 
  geom_point()
```
{{<figure src="unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" alt="HDR rug and scatter plots in two dimensions constructed through the gghdr package. The variables eruptions and waiting time from the faithful data set are shown. The rugs have three shades of gray, with the dark, medium, and light shades corresponding to 50%, 95%, and 99% probability coverage with local modes represented by lines inside the rugs.">}}

3. `hdr_bin()` to replace `hdrscatterplot()`. This would not be an independent geom, but rather a function to add in the aesthetic color with each color representing an HDR with a specified coverage.

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">

__Before:__
```r 
hdrscatterplot(faithful$waiting,
               faithful$eruptions)
```
{{<figure src="hdrcde-scatterplot-1.png" alt="The scatterplot shows the highest density regions constructed through the hdrcde package. The variables eruptions is shown on the y-axis and waiting time shown on the x-axis. The points are colored according to the bivariate HDRs for probability coverages 50%, 95%, 99% and >99%.">}}
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">

__After:__
```r 
ggplot(data = faithful, 
       aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = hdr_bin(x = waiting,
                                  y = eruptions)))
```
{{<figure src="gghdr-scatterplot-1.png" alt="A HDR scatterplot similar to the last plot constructed through the gghdr package.">}}
</div>
</div>


4. `geom_hdr_boxplot()` with both `x` and `y` variables to replace `hdr.cde()` which is used in HDRs for a conditional density estimate. Modes for the conditional density estimates are represented through lines instead of dots.

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">

__Before:__
```r 
faithful.cde <- cde(faithful$eruptions, faithful$waiting)
plot(faithful.cde, plot.fn = "hdr",
     xlab = "eruptions", ylab = "waiting")
```
{{<figure src="hdrcde-cde-1.png" alt="Highest density regions of waiting times (on y-axis) conditional on different values of eruptions (on x-axis) constructed through the hdrcde package. The plot consists of side-by-side bars with each bar corresponding to a conditional highest density region for probability coverages of 50%, 95%, and 99%. The mode for each conditional density is represented by a black dot.">}}
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">

__After:__
```r 
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) + 
    geom_hdr_boxplot(fill="steelblue") + 
    theme_minimal()
```
{{<figure src="gghdr-cde-1.png" alt="Highest density regions of waiting times (on y-axis) conditional on different values of eruptions (on x-axis) constructed through the gghdr package. It appears similar to the last plot, with lines representing the modes for the conditional density estimate instead of dots.">}}
</div>
</div>




5. We also deliberated on names of potential functions at the brainstorming stage which led to the idea of a [package design collaboration corner](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf19/issues/19). 

6. Documentation, testing and illustrative followed along the way to make it CRAN ready.


# Bottlenecks along the way

Now where there's a will, there's a way. Except that soon we could say where there is a merge, there is a conflict.  While most times we use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code-sharing, publishing software and collaborating with our future self, this was the time to show how we collaborate with others. It took almost 2 hours with both GitKraken and Mitch helping us to deal with the merge conflicts!

<!-- knitr::include_graphics("conflict-tree.png") -->

{{< figure src = "conflict-tree.png" alt = "This photograph shows a conflict tree displaying a list of Github commits made by various team members.

# Where to from here?

We still have one thing to do (replace the `hdr.boxplot.2d()` with `geom_hdr_boxplot.2d()`, which would calculate and plot HDRs in two dimensions), but are happy to announce that with some embellishments and review, the current version is on CRAN. Kudos team!! You can learn about our package gghdr at [the package website](https://Sayani07.github.io/gghdr/), and the [Github repo](https://Sayani07.github.io/gghdr/).
