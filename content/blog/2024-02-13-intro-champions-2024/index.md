The rOpenSci Champions Program start this 2024 with a new cohort of champions.  We are pleased to introduce you to our champions and their projects.

## Ezekiel Adebayo Ogundepo

Hello, I'm Ezekiel, a data science professional deeply fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and real-world challenges. My journey in data science has been marked by several achievements, including being a Certified RStudio Tidyverse Instructor, a Mastercard Scholar, a Federal Government of Nigeria (FSB) Scholar, an UNLEASH Talent, a Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) Fellow and a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data Fellow.

I hold a B.Sc. in Statistics (First Class) and an M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences. My passion for research software development is evident in my contributions to CRAN, where I have developed packages like 'forstringr' and 'bulkreadr'.

My aspiration to further my impact in the field has led me to apply for the rOpenSci Championship program as a participant and reviewer. This program will enhance my skills and empower me to build and sustain a vibrant research software engineering community in Nigeria. My goal is to leverage the knowledge and experiences from the rOpenSci Champion program to grow personally and professionally, contributing significantly to the field of data science.

## Dr. Sehrish Kanwal

I am a bioinformatics scientist at the University of Melbourne Centre for Cancer Research (UMCCR). I graduated with a BS-honours degree in Bioinformatics from Pakistan and continued my career in Bioinformatics with a PhD from the School of Computing and Information Systems, the University of Melbourne, Australia. I am a highly experienced bioinformatician, specialised in the development of pipelines for the processing, mining, and integration of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, with a particular focus on precision oncology. 

As a Champion, my goal is to submit a WIP R package to the rOpenSci Peer Review committee. This offers me a valuable chance to gather insights into optimal practices for R package development. Navigating the review process with the rOpenSci Peer Review committee not only streamlines the eventual submission to CRAN but also enriches my understanding of the review process.

Through proactive engagement as an rOpenSci champion, I aim to enable collaboration and robust knowledge exchange, cultivate cross-institutional partnerships, whereby I can play a pivotal role in facilitating the exchange of expertise and resources, fostering mutual growth and advancement.
