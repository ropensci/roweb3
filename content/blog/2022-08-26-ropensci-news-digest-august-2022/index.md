Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/08/26/ropensci-news-digest-august-2022).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

### New pkgcheck check for undocumented return values

Our [pkgcheck checks](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck) now include an additional check that all functions have documented return values.
This check is [run on all new CRAN submissions](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks), yet is not currently implemented on any other standard check systems (including R CMD check).
Checking your packages with pkgcheck will now catch any functions which do not document return values, like in [the report on this recent submission](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/554#issuecomment-1224053977).
All current checks are also listed in [a new vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/articles/list-checks.html).

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following  package recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [spiro](https://docs.ropensci.org/spiro), developed by Simon Nolte: Import, process, summarize and visualize raw data from metabolic carts. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/541) by Manuel Ramon, and James Hunter.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Test your Shiny app with shinytest2!

Barret Schloerke developed a new package for testing Shiny apps, [shinytest2](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2).
It was presented in a [recorded RStudio conf talk](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/shinytest2-unit-testing-for-shiny/).

### Comparing package versions with Diffify

Diffify by Jumping Rivers provides you with a comparison between different versions of any R package stored on CRAN.
Colin Gillespie presented it in a [recorded RStudio conf talk](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/comparing-package-versions-diffify/).

### pkgdown missing topics or missing articles

If pkgdown complains about missing reference topics or articles:

* Edit `_pkgdown.yml` (see [`?pkgdown::build_reference`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_reference.html#reference-index) -- you can *choose* to omit topics; [`?pkgdown::build_articles`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_articles.html#index-and-navbar)).

* Then check everything is ok with [`pkgdown::check_pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/check_pkgdown.html). This is faster than rebuilding the whole site to check the configuration!
