## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Test your Shiny app with shinytest2!

Barret Schloerke developed a new package for testing Shiny apps, [shinytest2](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2).
It was presented in a [recorded RStudio conf talk](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/shinytest2-unit-testing-for-shiny/).

### Comparing package versions with Diffify

Diffify by Jumping Rivers provides you with a comparison between different versions of any R package stored on CRAN.
Colin Gillespie presented it in a [recorded RStudio conf talk](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/comparing-package-versions-diffify/).

### pkgdown missing topics or missing articles

If pkgdown complains about missing reference topics or articles:

* Edit `_pkgdown.yml` (see [`?pkgdown::build_reference`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_reference.html#reference-index) -- you can *choose* to omit topics; [`?pkgdown::build_articles`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_articles.html#index-and-navbar)).

* Then check everything is ok with [`pkgdown::check_pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/check_pkgdown.html). This is faster than rebuilding the whole site to check the configuration!

*️ edit _pkgdown.yml (see[ ?pkgdown::build_reference -- you can *choose* to omit topics; )
heck everything is ok with pkgdown::check_pkgdown() https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/chec
