## TL;DR

`rsnps` is a package that enables the retrieval of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the  [NCBI's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) database and [openSNP](https://opensnp.org/) by providing wrappers for the APIs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms represent differences at one specific position in a detected biological sequence compared to the reference. 

`ncbi_snp_query()` now returns all reported variant allele frequencies in dbSNP in column `maf_population` in form of a `tibble`. Previously (version <= 0.4.0), it reported only the allele frequency from [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) in column `maf` as a `data.frame`. 

## Changes

The [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/rsnps/blob/master/NEWS.md) file will tell you about the changes of rsnps 0.4.0 to 0.5.0, but there is one change that we think will be particularly relevant to users which we will highlight in this blog post.

`ncbi_snp_query()` is the function that pulls data from [NCBI's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), a database of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). This database lets a user query for a SNP of interest and returns a plethora of information, among them genomic position, associated gene, clinical significance, and - relevant for this blogpost - the allele frequency. The allele frequency varies typically (on average) between different populations, sometimes just a little (e.g. [rs562556](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs562556#frequency_tab)), sometimes a lot (e.g. [rs11677783](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs11677783#frequency_tab)). This is why [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) collects allele frequency estimates from different studies and populations.

Until version 0.4.0 `ncbi_snp_query()` reported the allele frequency estimated from [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). For example, for SNP `rs420358` the `ncbi_snp_query()` output used to look like this:

```r
ncbi_snp_query("rs420358")

#>          query chromosome        bp class         rsid          gene
#> 2     rs420358          1  40341239   snv     rs420358              

#>       alleles ancestral_allele variation_allele      seqname
#> 2     A,C,G,T                A            C,G,T NC_000001.11

#>     assembly ref_seq minor    maf
#> 2 GRCh38.p12       A     C 0.8614
```

We have now changed two things:

1. `ncbi_snp_query()` output now includes a new `maf_population` column which contains all reported allele frequencies, not only from one study or population (for backwards compatibility, the `maf` column stays the same).
2. To do that, `ncbi_snp_query()` returns now a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) (and not a data frame). 


## Examples

Let's have a look at the output of the two SNPs mentioned above. You can see that a) `maf_population` is a new list-column (`<list>`), and b) `dat` is a tibble.


```{r setupexample, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
library(patchwork)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(forcats)
```

```{r query}
library(rsnps)
(dat <- ncbi_snp_query(c("rs11677783", "rs562556")))
```


### One row per study ("long data")

Here is a visual to show how much the allele frequencies vary per SNP. 

First, we **lengthen** the data frame, so that each SNP and population/study are on a **separate line**. 
```{r maf}
(dat_maf <- dat %>% 
   select(query, maf_population) %>% 
   unnest(cols = c(maf_population)))
```

Then we display it with the allele frequency on the x-axis and the study along the y-axis. 

```{r plot-maf, hugoopts=list(alt="Two figures displaying the allele frequency for two genetic variants (rs11677783, rs562556). Each figure is a dot plot with study along the vertical, y-axis and MAF along the horizontal, x-axis. The studies are arranged in ascending order of MAF", caption="Allele frequencies in dbSNP for rs11677783, rs562556 and various studies/populations.", width=800), fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.6}

p1 <- ggplot(data = dat_maf %>% filter(query == "rs11677783") %>% mutate(study = forcats::fct_reorder(study, MAF ))) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(0, 0.5, 1), linetype = 3, color ="gray") +
  geom_point(aes(MAF, study)) + 
  labs(title = "Allele frequency", subtitle = "rs11677783") 

p2 <- ggplot(data = dat_maf %>% filter(query == "rs562556") %>% mutate(study = forcats::fct_reorder(study, MAF ))) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(0, 0.5, 1), linetype = 3, color ="gray") +
  geom_point(aes(MAF, study)) + 
  labs(title = "Allele frequency", subtitle = "rs562556") 

p1 + p2

```
### One study as column 

We can decide to turn the tibble into a data frame again and pick a **specific study**. For example, here we use the `map()` function from the [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) package to pull out the study which matches "KOREAN" from the `maf_population` list. Note that our new column, `maf_korean` is a `dbl`, and not a `list`: 
 
```{r mafkorean}
(dat_korean <- dat %>% 
   mutate(maf_korean = purrr::map(maf_population, ~..1$MAF[..1$study=="KOREAN"])) %>% 
   unnest(cols = c(maf_korean)))
                  
```

### One column per study ("wide data")
Lastly, we can decide to pivot the study allele frequencies, so that **each study** has its **own column**:

```{r mafcolumn}
       
dat_maf <- dat %>% 
  select(query, maf_population) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(maf_population)) %>%
  select(query, study, MAF) %>%
  pivot_wider(values_from = "MAF", names_from = "study", values_fn = min, names_prefix = "maf_") ## if duplicate, picking the minimum

(dat_wide <- left_join(dat, dat_maf, by = "query"))
           
```

## Conclusion

We have highlighted important changes in `ncbi_snp_query()` whereby this function now returns a tibble, the column `maf_population` now returns all allele frequencies available in the NCBI database, and finally `maf_population` is now a list column instead of a regular column. These improvements which provide additional information and functionality to this package are available in the most recent version of rnsps available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsnps/index.html) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/rsnps).
