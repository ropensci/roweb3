Maintaining a package can be a lonesome activity, which sometimes poses a problem if you'd prefer team work or if you encounter a very thorny for you problem.
Beside belonging to a supportive community of maintainers, like rOpenSci :wink:, for collaborative help and commiseration, you can try to build a community of contributors around your package!
In this post, we'll underline one tool helping you towards that goal: help-wanted issues, with which your repository could attract, and retain, new developers!

## What are help wanted issues?

Help wanted issues are issues for which you'd accept or need external contributions.
They are labelled with the community standard "help wanted" label.

For some of them, if they're not too involved, or a good onboarding ramp to your codebase, you can also use the ["good first issue" label](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/encouraging-helpful-contributions-to-your-project-with-labels).

## Select (or unwillingly incur) help-wanted topics

### The topics you don't choose: development hurdles

You don't get to choose all the help wanted issue: sometimes a hurdle very clearly appear on the road to your next development milestone.
At this stage you can either
- ask for help in an usual channel (rOpenSci Slack's package-maintenance channel if you're in that workspace; Posit community forum...);
- open an issue in an upstream dependency if that's where the actual problem is;
- open an issue in your repository describing your problem.

For instance, when working on tinkr Maëlle opened a [very specific issue](https://github.com/ropensci/tinkr/issues/9) that did end up getting miraculous outside help.

You can also add the "help wanted" label to a bug report or feature request someone else opened in your package!
With a bit of luck, the issue creator themselves will be able to participate?

### The topics you choose: delegating out of necessity or willingness to grow your team

Now sometimes there are some upkeep or enhancement ideas you have for your package for which you don't have time right now, or that are not urgent.
For instance, [updating the testing infrastructure to testthat third edition](https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/issues/183), or [adding terra support to a spatial package](https://github.com/ropensci/landscapetools/issues/33).
By listing them in your issue tracker, 

- you show curious users that they're on your mind, 
- you can organize your own work... 
- and you can receive external help if you signal it's ok, with the "help-wanted" label.

## Polish your issue and contributing guide

Once you have a topic in mind, make the issue title and text as clear as possible.
Even if you are the one fixing the issue in the end, future you will be happy you didn't jot down an undecipherable comment.
Link to resources as needed, indicate context.
Approach the issue writing as you approach the issue writing in a repo that isn't yours: challenge description, desired outcome, trade-offs, etc.

Beyond efforts in the individual issue, it's crucial to have a [contributing guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#contributing-guide) underlining anything that is good to know about contributing to your package: tooling used, style and design preferences.
Do not duplicate external resources, point to them instead.
Do not overload or scare off contributors by having too strict requirements: you can probably finish off PRs yourself, or teach them little by little. 

## Broadcast your need for help

First of all, help-wanted issues of rOpenSci packages are broadcasted to the community via a [dedicated page on the website](/help-wanted), and social media posts!

Then you could also share it within your own networks: rOpenSci slack workspace, your Mastodon account, a local R User Group communication channel, etc.

## Thank contributors

If someone answers in the issue or open a PR, try to be somewhat responsive.
Check your settings allow you to be notified of issue comments and PRs, you might need to [watch](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions) your repository.

Acknowledge contributions [generously](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html?q=generous#attributions).

## Don't despair

Even if you wrote an excellent issue, it might just not get picked up.
In that case, alternatives or complements might be to broadcast it again, ask for general tips to your fellow maintainers, try and get funding (therefore time, either yours or an external contractor's?) for your maintenance efforts.

## Conclusion

Opening help-wanted issues can be a way to grow your package contributors' community.
They might appear as a potential loss of time if no one tackles the issue in the end, but it might be good to have thought about the issue resolution even if you solve it yourself in the end.
