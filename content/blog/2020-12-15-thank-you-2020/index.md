In a year where it has been hard to pay attention to anything not critical to our day-to-day lives, you have continued to share your time, expertise, enthusiasm, and willingness to try things with us. Our [staff](/about/#team) of developers, researchers, and community builders work to create technical and social infrastructure to lower barriers to working with research data, and you, our community, continually help us push farther.

On behalf of rOpenSci, thank you. 

People have submitted their R packages for [software peer review](/software-review/) (16 package authors)[^1], reviewed those packages (31 [reviewers](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html#reviewers)), contributed code or documentation (84 people made their first code contribution to rOpenSci this year), authored a [blog post or tech note](/archive/) (43 community member authors, including 21 first-time authors), shared a [use case](/usecases/) to help package authors see how their work is being used and help other users imagine how they can apply it (42 people), attended a [Community Call](/commcalls/) (136 people in 19 countries), cited our software (380 [citations](/citations/) of 132 [packages](/packages/all/)), asked or answered questions, commented on project ideas, added notes to a public doc, invited us to talk about our work, or gave us a shoutout in a presentation, a post, or on Twitter.
