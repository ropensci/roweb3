On June 14 I was invited to present at the [CZI Open Science 2024](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/open-science/) event. I was asked to participate on the Case Study Session 3: Demonstrating Impact of Open Science and explore the challenges of using traditional academic metrics for measuring project impact and emphasize alternative approaches.

I was very excited to share our experience with the community and to learn from others. In this blog post there is a summary of my talk and some of the questions that were asked during the session.

## Metrics

rOpenSci is a non-profit organization and a community of practice that lead a set of interrelated activities around capacity building, community development, and research software development practices to transform science through open data, software & reproducibility.

As many other organizations we have a set of _traditional_ metrics that we use to measure the impact of our work. We use dashboards, we have our automatic process to calculate those metrics and we also use software that serve some other metrics to us. We calculate this metrics by project or activity and by the overall organization.

For example, our Software Peer Review is a transparent, open, non-adversarial R package peer review process with the goal of improve the software we build to made science. Since it started we have review more than  

* 200+ scientific software packages 
* 577 reviewers
* 700 unique contributors
* 17,205,280 downloads

Even when those numbers are impressive, we know that they are not enough to measure the impact of our work. Because a community is not just about numbers, but about people, because communities are built on connections.  

## Framework to measure impact

We use two frameworks with a community management lens to capture metrics and try to measure our impact. The first one is a _four impact level_ framework: individual level, host institution/local community level, the community level, and the Open Science Community in general.

### Impact level framework

To exemplify this framework, let me introduce you to Marcos Miguel Prunello, a professor of statistics at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario in Argentina and one of our Champions.

#### Individual level

Being part of the champions program Marcos recibe training on package development and community outreach. He also has individual mentoring, a cohort of colleagues to share experiences and knowledge during the program and paid time to develop a project in 12 months. He has also access to a network of experts in R and data science through rOpenSci community.

> The program allowed people who aren't typically represented to have opportunities. - Marcos Prunello

#### Host institution/local community level

As part of his activities on the Champions Program, Marcos organized a [workshops in Spanish on how to develop R packages and made them multilingual](/events/r-en-rosario-champions/
).  He also delivered a talk about rOpenSci and how to participate, sharing his knowledge with his colleagues and students, and the local community.

The workshop and talk was organized jointly with RenRosario R User Group and the Universidad Nacional de Rosario, that provide the venue for the event. 

> The revival of our R user group in our city was motivating to me. I organized a workshop. After that, we had another meeting, and another one planned. - Marcos Prunello

#### Community level

Marco's project on the champions program was to get his [karel R package]() in shape and submit it for software peer review. 

The package that implements _Karel the robot_ to teach introductory programming concepts. Marcos' students speak in Spanish so he want the package in this language, at the same time he wants other educators can use karel and for that we provide the documentation and lessons in English.
