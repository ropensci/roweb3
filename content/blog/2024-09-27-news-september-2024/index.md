<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2024/09/27/news-september-2024).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Community call recording: Navigating the R ecosystem using R-universe

[Video and resources](/commcalls/nov2024-r-universe/).

Learn more about R-Universe and how you can use it to improve your R package development workflow.

In this community call, [Jeroen Ooms](/author/jeroen-ooms/) provided details on what R-Universe is and an update on what you can do with it today. 
He also discussed the future of R-Universe and how it can be used to navigate the R ecosystem.

### R-Universe list pages

R-Universe now features a [list of all datasets in all packages](https://r-universe.dev/datasets) and a [list of all vignettes  from CRAN, Bioconductor, and others](https://r-universe.dev/articles).

Another important global table is the [package scoreboard](https://r-universe.dev/scores) that lets you explore the scores used by R-Universe search engine for ranking, which is based on:

- Stars: Number of stars on GitHub;
- Downloads per month from CRAN or Bioconductor mirrors;
- Scripts: (NEW) number of files on GitHub that mention 'library(pkgname)';
- Dependents: recursive reverse dependencies;
- Unique contributors;
- Yearly commits.

### Resources from rOpenSci training sessions

We've added a searchable table of [past training sessions](/training/) to our resources hosted on the rOpenSci website.
Explore the full list of our [resources](/resources).

### Noam Ross, rOpenSci, and communities empowering open science

DataLatam Podcast [interviewed](https://www.datalatam.com/109/) rOpenSci director Noam Ross. 
Learn about his work at the intersection of health and the environment and his journey with rOpenSci.

### Materials: Screen Reader Accessible Tools and Resources for Learning and Working with R

We have now published the recording of the webinar that walks through learning and using R with screen readers — and it's bilingual (English & Turkish)! with subtitles in English.

📹 [Webinar video](https://vimeo.com/1008631708) featuring [Liz Hare, PhD](/author/liz-hare/)
and [Alican Cagri Gokcek](/author/alican-cagri-gokcek/)

Also, don't miss the [detailed technical note](/blog/2024/09/05/screen-readers-tools/) by Liz Hare with all the necessary resources to get started.

### The rOpenSci community at upcoming events

rOpenSci Community Manager [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/) will deliver a keynote talk at [BioNT Community Event & CarpentryConnect-Heidelberg 2024](/events/carpentryconnect-2024/), on November 14th in Heidelberg, Germany.

[Will Landau](/author/will-landau/) will deliver a keynote talk at [LatinR (Latin American Conference About the Use of R in R&D)](/events/latinr-2024/). The conference is happening online from November 18-22. 


### Coworking

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [eDNAjoint](https://docs.ropensci.org/eDNAjoint), developed by Abigail G. Keller: Models integrate environmental DNA (eDNA) detection data and traditional survey data to jointly estimate species catch rate (see package vignette: https://bookdown.org/abigailkeller/eDNAjoint_vignette/). Models can be used with count data via traditional survey methods (i.e., trapping, electrofishing, visual) and replicated eDNA detection/nondetection data via polymerase chain reaction (i.e., PCR or qPCR) from multiple survey locations. Estimated parameters include probability of a false positive eDNA detection, a site-level covariates that scale the sensitivity of eDNA surveys relative to traditional surveys, and catchability coefficients for traditional gear types. Models are implemented with a Bayesian framework (Markov chain Monte Carlo) using the Stan probabilistic programming language. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/642) by Chitra M Saraswati and Saras Windecker.

+ [rix](https://docs.ropensci.org/rix), developed by Bruno Rodrigues together with Philipp Baumann: Simplifies the creation of reproducible data science environments using the Nix package manager, as described in Dolstra (2006) <ISBN 90-393-4130-3>. The included `rix()` function generates a complete description of the environment as a `default.nix` file, which can then be built using Nix. This results in project specific software environments with pinned versions of R, packages, linked system dependencies, and other tools. Additional helpers make it easy to run R code in Nix software environments for testing and production.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rix). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/625) by David Watkins and Jacob Wujiciak-Jens.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Reminder: R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) Grant Program Accepting Proposals until October 1st!

The R Consortium [Call for Proposals](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals) might be a relevant funding opportunity for your package!
If you can't prepare your proposal in time, the next call should start [March 1st 2025](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals).

### How to demonstrate an error in an R Markdown vignette

An useful piece of information shared by Hugo Gruson in our [Slack workspace](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels).
To demonstrate an error in a vignette, try setting `purl = FALSE` in chunks with `error = TRUE`.
[More info in a knitr issue](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/2338).

### Better titles for roxygen2 "family" cross-references

Do you use the "family" roxygen2 tag for grouping and cross-linking manual pages?
Did you know you can override the default title from, for instance, "Other blabla" to "blabla functions and related data"?
If not, refer to [roxygen2 documentation](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/index-crossref.html#family).

### Create and use a custom roxygen2 tag

Read more about creating a custom tag that adds a new section to a manual page in this [blog post by Maëlle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu/2024/09/03/roxygen2-custom-tag/).

### Materials from posit::conf(2024) workshops

Materials from posit::conf(2024) workshops have been [posted](https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/workshops/).
Especially relevant to package developers: [From R User to R Programmer](https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/programming-r/) by Emma Rand and Ian Lyttle; and [Package Development: The Rest of the Owl](https://github.com/posit-conf-2024/pkg-dev) by Jenny Bryan whose introduction slidedeck features GitHub search tips.

### Some tips when searching GitHub issues

Speaking of GitHub search...

Michael Chirico shared the following tip on Mastodon: ["[you can use] the 'in:title' operator in GitHub search to restrict a search to issues/PRs matching a query in the title"](https://fosstodon.org/@michaelchirico/113083595380080927).

Jenny Bryan answered with another tip: ["involves:USERNAME" for "I was once part of a conversation about this"](https://mastodon.social/@jennybryan@fosstodon.org/113085363392572924).

### A usethis function to create a test helper file

The new usethis function [` usethis::use_test_helper("mocks")`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_test_helper.html) will create a [helper file](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/special-files.html) under `tests/testthat/helper-mocks.R`.

### A devtools function for building the README and vignettes

Not a new function, but in case you missed it...
The [`devtools::build_rmd()` and `devtools::build_readme()` functions](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/build_rmd.html) render R Markdown files using a temporary install of your current development package.
