Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/05/21/ropensci-news-digest-may-2021).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

We have no less than three categories of (online :wink:) events coming up: social co-working events, a community call, a conference with contributions from four rOpenSci staff members. :sparkles:

### Community Calls

* Our next community call is about [**rOpenSci's R-universe Project**](/commcalls/may2021-r-universe/) and will take place on Tuesday, 25 May 2021 17:00 UTC. The R-universe platform is a new umbrella project under which rOpenSci experiments with new ideas for improving publication and discovery of research software packages in R. In this 1-hour community call, **Jeroen Ooms** will explain the basic steps of setting up your own universe, and getting started with publishing packages (including experimental software, development versions, [research compendia](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/04/09/r-universe-articles/)) and articles on your [personal subdomain](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev). We are interested in hearing your thoughts and ideas on how this infrastructure can improve how researchers publish and discover R packages and related content.

* Video and resources from our past community call [**Set Up Your Package to Foster a Community**](/commcalls/apr2021-pkg-community/) were posted. rOpenSci puts ongoing effort into exploring and communicating how developers can best attract attention to their package (e.g. usage, citations, or feedback), or how to set up their repository to encourage the types of contributions they want. In this 1-hour community call, **Maëlle Salmon**, **Hugo Gruson**, and **Steffi LaZerte** shared tips and examples on how to do this! **Sina Rüeger** [summarized the call](/blog/2021/04/28/commcall-pkg-community/) with help from Mark Padgham.

### Social Co-Working

We held our first two **Social Co-Working and Label-athon events** on April 29th and May 13th. 
These were truly **international events** with 14 participants from Canada, Germany, Switzerland, USA, the UK, France, Singapore, and Mexico. 
We had a blast **socializing (scavenger hunts!) and co-working on our personal R projects** including repository organization, creating/labelling issues, preliminary research, personal GitHub README files, and those packages you can never find time for. 
We had **quiet and noisy rooms** to work in, so everyone was able to find an environment that worked best for them.
Sound like fun? We have **two more coming up**! 

- [Thursday May 27th 9am Pacific](/events/labelathon03/) (16:00 UTC) - [Registration encouraged!](https://form.jotform.com/211236537172249)

- [Thursday June 10th 5pm Pacific](/events/labelathon04/) (Fri June 11th 00:00 UTC) - [Registration encouraged!](https://form.jotform.com/211236201763243)

### rOpenSci at useR! 2021

[Registration](https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/registration/) for the **useR! 2021 conference** has begun, with  Early Bird Deadline until May 28th. 
useR! conferences are non-profit conferences organized by community volunteers for the community, supported by the R Foundation.
useR! 2021 will take place online.

Get excited for four contributions by rOpenSci staff members:

* **Jeroen Ooms**, rOpenSci Lead Infrastructure Engineer, will give a [**keynote talk**](https://user2021.r-project.org/program/keynotes/) about **building a modern and scalable package build infrastructure**, such as R-universe.

* **Maëlle Salmon**, Research Software Engineer with rOpenSci, will give a [tutorial](https://user2021.r-project.org/program/tutorials/), _**GET better at testing your R package!**_ on Wednesday, July the 7th at 9-12AM GMT+2. This tutorial is about advanced testing of R packages, with HTTP testing as a case study.

* **Stefanie Butland**, rOpenSci community manager, will present on **rOpenSci's Model for Managing a Federated Open Source Software Community**.

* **Mark Padgham**, rOpenSci Software Research Scientist, will also give a regular talk, about his original **autotest** package for automatic testing of packages.

### Software review in Spanish

Beside events, another great piece of news: censo2017 was the first package to pass ** rOpenSci software peer-review in Spanish**! :tada:
[censo2017](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/414) by [Pachá (aka Mauricio Vargas Sepúlveda)](/author/pachá-aka-mauricio-vargas-sepúlveda/) provides access to the 2017 Chilean Census.
Editor [Melina Vidoni](/blog/2019/01/31/more_editors/) was in charge of this review, the reviewers were [Frans van Dunné](https://github.com/FvD) and [María Paula Caldas](https://www.mpaulacaldas.com/).
Frans van Dunné most kindly translated our [review template to Spanish](https://devguide.ropensci.org/reviewtemplatees.html)!

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [censo2017](https://docs.ropensci.org/censo2017), developed by Mauricio Vargas: Provee un acceso conveniente a mas de 17 millones de registros de la base de datos del Censo 2017. Los datos fueron importados desde el DVD oficial del INE usando el Convertidor REDATAM creado por Pablo De Grande. Esta paquete esta documentado intencionalmente en castellano asciificado para que funcione sin problema en diferentes plataformas. (Provides convenient access to more than 17 million records from the Chilean Census 2017 database. The datasets were imported from the official DVD provided by the Chilean National Bureau of Statistics by using the REDATAM converter created by Pablo De Grande and in addition it includes the maps accompanying these datasets.).  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=censo2017). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/414) by Frans van Dunné, Maria Paula Caldas.

+ [exoplanets](https://docs.ropensci.org/exoplanets), developed by Tyler Littlefield: The goal of exoplanets is to provide access to NASA's Exoplanet Archive TAP Service. For more information regarding the API please read the documentation <https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html>. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/309) by Maëlle Salmon, Nichole Monhait.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

Sometimes you find yourself documenting internal functions with roxygen2 without really wanting everyone to get to see the docs.
Do you know the [**difference between the `@internal` and `@NoRd` tags**](https://community.rstudio.com/t/keywords-internal-vs-nord/35119/3)?
* Keyword [`@internal`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#indexing) means there will be a manual page for the function but it won't be in the documentation index. " `@keywords internal` is useful because it removes the function from the documentation index; it’s useful for functions aimed primarily at other developers, not typical users of the package."
* `@NoRd` means there won't even be a manual page so the roxygen2 documentation of that function only lives in the R script. 
We at rOpenSci [recommend not having manual pages for internal functions](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html): " Add `#' @noRd` to internal functions". It is also recommended in the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html#internal-functions).

Speaking of documentation, when writing **examples**, do you know the difference between **`\dontrun{}`**, **`\donttest{}`** and **`\dontshow{}`**?
(Is this newsletter section turning into a quizz? :sweat_smile:)
The roxygen2 docs feature [a  table](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#functions) explaining when different types of examples are run depending on the context (in `example()`,	`help()`, `R CMD check`, `R CMD check –as-cran`) which is very useful when you wonder how to safeguard your package examples on e.g. CRAN.
The same documentation section introduces the very handy **`@examplesIf`** roxygen2 tag that you can use for finer control.

Now on to **code archaeology**!
Do you want to ["pinpoint the version at which a certain argument appeared in a specific function of a package (or that its default value changed)"](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1343636610982662144), e.g. to figure out the minimal version required?
You might like the [**apicheck package** by David Hugh-Jones](https://github.com/hughjonesd/apicheck), that helps you "explore the historical API of functions in CRAN packages"; and [**rcheology** by the same author](https://github.com/hughjonesd/rcheology) for data on base packages.
Related to this are:

* [Using **git blame on the package NAMESPACE** to see when a function appeared](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1387439721157038080),
* The R-hub's [**CRAN source code mirror**](https://docs.r-hub.io/#cran-source-code-mirror): each repo is a CRAN package, each commit is the change between two versions of that package.
