## What is pkgcheck?

The [pkgcheck package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck) has
been developed by rOpenSci to automate the process of checking all packages on
submission. The `ropensci-review-bot` automatically runs pkgcheck on all submissions, and checks can also be called at any time by editors using the command:

```r
@ropensci-review-bot check package
```

The bot will return a list of checks which should ideally look like this:

{{< figure src="cffr-pkgcheck.png" alt="pkgcheck results for recent submission" link="https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/463#issuecomment-921010197">}}

To be ready for peer review, pkgcheck should return a series of &#10004;, indicating successful checks, and there shouldn't be any &#10008; symbols, which indicate failed checks. Anybody preparing a package to submit is recommended to ["use pkgcheck"](https://devguide.ropensci.org/authors-guide.html) to confirm that a package is indeed ready to submit. Until now, this has only been possible through locally [installing the package and running the `pkgcheck()` command](https://devguide.ropensci.org/authors-guide.html). Local checks suffer two important disadvantages:

1. Results may only be reproducible on a local system, rather than be generally reproducible; and
2. The checks run by pkgcheck include all checks run by [the rcmdcheck package](https://r-lib.github.io/rcmdcheck/) which may take quite some time to run.

Just like the [GitHub rcmdcheck action](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/check-standard.yaml) which can be easily installed with one of [the `use_github_action_check_...` functions from the `usethis` package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github_actions.html), pkgcheck now also has a GitHub action which overcomes both of these disadvantages through running remotely (on GitHub), and generating reproducible results.

## The GitHub pkgcheck-action

This post is the "official" release announcement of pkgcheck-action, a GitHub action which enables checks to be run every time code is pushed to GitHub. The action was developed by one of us (Jacob), and can be found [on GitHub at ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action). The easiest way to use this action in your own repository is to install [the pkgcheck package](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/#installation), and run [the `use_github_action_pkgcheck()` function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/reference/use_github_action_pkgcheck.html). That will place a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your package called "pkgcheck.yaml", an example of which is shown on [the main README of the pkgcheck-action repository](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action#usage). The action consists of the single job expressed in the final lines:

```yaml
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action@main
```

There are several parameters also described in that main README, which can either be passed as parameters to [the `use_github_action_pkgcheck()` function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/reference/use_github_action_pkgcheck.html), or added to the YAML workflow file as also described in the README. Once the action has been created in your repository, it can be activated by adding it in a git commit and pushing to GitHub.

### Posting pkgcheck results to a GitHub issue

In addition to the workflow printing the full details returned by the main pkgcheck function, the output of pkgcheck can also be posted to a GitHub issue, where it will appear precisely like the example shown above. Once the workflow has finished, you'll receive a notification, and be able to view the check results (with a `summary-only` parameter determining whether only a summary of results like shown above will be posted to the issue, or whether full results will be posted which include the summary followed by quite a bit more detail). The workflow will only succeed when all pkgcheck checks have been passed.

## Using pkgcheck-action to prepare for submission

This action makes preparing packages for submission to peer review with rOpenSci much easier, by automatically confirming whether a package the general requirements for rOpenSci submissions. You can use pkgcheck-action to confirm that a package is ready for submission by following these three easy steps:

1. Insert the action into your repository with [`pkgcheck::use_github_action_pkgcheck()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/reference/use_github_action_pkgcheck.html).
2. Add and commit the action script to your git index, and push to GitHub to activate it.
3. Examine results in the automatically-created issue of your GitHub repository, modify the repository to address any failing checks, and iterate.
4. Once the action passes, you'll see "&#10004; This package may be submitted."

You can also put a pkgcheck} badge in your README by inserting a modified version of these lines:

```md
[![pkgcheck](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/workflows/pkgcheck/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/actions?query=workflow%3Apkgcheck)
```

Once your package passes all tests, the badge will turn green and look like this:
