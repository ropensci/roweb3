The rOpenSci project is 100% supported by grants and donations. If you're giving this season, please consider [donating to rOpenSci](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-ropensci/index.html). Your donations allow us to support internships, contractors, web services, and community events.

We foster a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. Our community in collaboration with our staff produce and maintain a vast collection of free open source software to support and accelerate scientific discovery. Hundreds of people have contributed their creativity, curiosity, smarts, and time in the last year. For a glimpse, see [Thank You to the rOpenSci Community, 2020](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/12/15/thankyou-2020/).

rOpenSci is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the United States that provides rOpenSci with fiscal, legal, and administrative support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Donations to rOpenSci are managed by NumFOCUS. For donors in the United States, your gift is tax-deductible to the extent provided by law. 

Donations made by Dec 31 will result in a 1-for-1 matching donation to NumFOCUS, enabled by their corporate sponsors.
