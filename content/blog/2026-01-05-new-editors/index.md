At rOpenSci we’re continually grateful for the support and engagement of our community who help make our open-source ecosystem stronger, more inclusive, and more collaborative. The [software peer review program](/software-review/) is one of the best examples of this: bringing together people from diverse expertise and backgrounds to improve the quality, reproducibility, and usability of scientific software across the R ecosystem.

Today we’re excited to welcome Natalia Da Silvia and Andrew Heiss as new editors for our Statistical Software Peer Review team. Their expertise and dedication will help grow and sustain this important program, ensuring that statistical software reviews maintain high standards and continue to improve in quality and impact.

Meet our new editors!

## About the Statistical Software Peer Review Program

rOpenSci’s software peer review program brings together volunteers to collaboratively review scientific and statistical software according to transparent, constructive, and open standards. Editors manage submissions, coordinate reviewers, and help guide packages through review to improve code quality, documentation, and usability. 

This program is possible thanks to the many community members: authors submitting their packages, reviewers volunteering their time and expertise, and editors like Natalia and Andrew who help shepherd reviews and maintain a supportive process.
