At rOpenSci we’re continually grateful for the support and engagement of our community who help make our open-source ecosystem stronger, more inclusive, and more collaborative. The [software peer review program](/software-review/) is one of the best examples of this: bringing together people from diverse expertise and backgrounds to improve the quality, reproducibility, and usability of scientific software across the R ecosystem.

Today we’re excited to welcome Natalia Da Silvia and Andrew Heiss as new editors for our Statistical Software Peer Review team. Their expertise and dedication will help grow and sustain this important program, ensuring that statistical software reviews maintain high standards and continue to improve in quality and impact.

Meet our new editors!

> I learned about rOpenSci in 2019 when I reviewed rtweet and I loved the whole review process and how transparent and collaborative everything felt—it was a wild contrast from standard academic peer review! Since then, I've held rOpenSci's package guidelines, documentation standards, and review process as a gold standard for my own work. I love the rOpenSci community and everything they do to contribute to the broader R community and open science movement and I'm thrilled to be able to join in as an editor!
