Our second cohort of the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) has now completed the second phase of the program by developing their project and carrying out outreach activities. In this article, we share each Champion's project, their achievements and their outreach activities.

## Champions' Projects

In their applications Champions choose to develop a new package or to participate in the review process as authors or reviewers.

## Outreach Activities

Our Champions carried out a wide range of outreach activities like talks, conference papers, workshops, blog articles, community calls and meetups. The objective of these activities was to share what they did and learned during the program with their communities beyond rOpenSci.  

Outreach activities started in August 2024 involving local communities (universities, RUGs, R-Ladies Chapters, conferences, and organizations) and delivered in Champions’ native language (English, Spanish, and Portuguese).

Members of this cohort worked together with champions from the first cohort to do theirs outreach activities and also introduce their cohort mates to other communities and organizations giving them space to share what they did during the champions program.

### Workshops

Paola Corrales developed and delivered an online workshop for non-selected applicants on [Git and GitHub](https://paocorrales.github.io/git-developing-software-together/) already giving back to the program. She will also teach this workshop for the second cohort.

### Community Calls and Coworking sessions



### R User Groups and R-Ladies meetups


### Talks and Blog post

Our Champions are part of other communities like R-Ladies, LatinR and local R User Groups, and organized several activities with these groups. 


## Champions' accomplishments and next steps

Our Champions have been very successful in the delivery of their projects, building high quality software with a focus on their countries and discipline. The impact of their work also spread to their home institutions and related local communities. Not only through their outreach activities sharing information and knowledge contextualized for their audience, but also by creating spaces for their local communities, like the R user groups, and through their research. 

Many of our Champions will continue with their outreach activities and mantaining their R package. Stay tuned to our events section in our website, our newsletter and social media to learn about them!
