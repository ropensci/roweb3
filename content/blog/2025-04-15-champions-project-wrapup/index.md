Our second cohort of the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) has now completed the second phase of the program by developing their project and carrying out outreach activities. In this article, we share each Champion's project, their achievements and their outreach activities.

## Champions' Projects

In their applications Champions choose to develop a new package or to participate in the review process as authors or reviewers.

### New packages 

- **Andrea Gomez Vargas**, from Argentina, developed the package [arcenso](https://soyandrea.github.io/arcenso/). to allow access to the official data of the national population censuses in Argentina from the National Institute of Statistics and Census - INDEC and make this historical census data available, homogenized, and ready to use.  Her mentor is [Luis Verde](/author/luis-verde-arregoitia/) from Mexico. You can learn more about the package in [the blog post Andrea wrote about her project and her journey on the program](/blog/2025/05/15/puentes-comunidades-campeones-ropensci/).

- **Francesca Belem Lopes Palmeira**, from Brazil, developed a new package called [pcir: 'Potential for Conflict Index - PCI'](https://fblpalmeira.github.io/pcir/), which is a descriptive statistical method used to enhance the understanding of outcomes in human dimensions research. The package equip users with the tools required for calculating, comparing, and graphing the potential for conflict. Her mentor is [Bruna Wundervald](/author/bruna-wundervald/) from Brazil. 

- **Sunny Tseng**, from Taiwan, now living in Canada, developed [bbsTaiwan](https://sunnytseng.github.io/bbsTaiwan/). This is an R package to streamline Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data retrieval and analysis. bbsTaiwan facilitates data access from GBIF, where Taiwan BBS data are stored. Users can tailor species analysis, controlling data stratification, preparation, and mapping. Sunny's mentor is [Eunseop Kim](/author/eunseop-kim/) from South Korea, now living in the USA.

- **Erika Siregar**, from Indonesia, worked on developing [rplaywright](https://erikaris.github.io/rplaywright/) an R package seamlessly bridge with the NodeJS library, Playwright, enabling simplified web testing and automation for R users. This package aims to provide R users with a comprehensive toolkit for interacting with web browsers programmatically, allowing for tasks such as browser automation, web scraping, and end-to-end testing directly from within the R environment. Her mentor is [Apoor Anand](/author/apoorv-anand/) from India. 


### Improving and reviewing existing packages

- **Ezekiel Adebayo Ogundepo** from Nigeria, worked on the [bulkreadr](https://docs.ropensci.org/naijR/) package, which is a package designed to optimize the process of importing and processing large datasets provinding compatibility with several formats files from several statistical softwares and spreadsheets. Ezekiel worked on enhanced functions functionality and lunch the [official website of the package](https://gbganalyst.github.io/bulkreadr/news/index.html). His mentor was [Francisco Cardozo](/author/francisco-cardozo/) from Colombia.

- **Liz Hare** from the US, worked as reviewer on the software peer review of the [emodnet.wfs](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/653) package, provide helpers to access EMODnet Web Feature Service data through R.  Her mentor was [François Michonneau](/author/françois-michonneau/) from France.

- **Sehrish Kanwal**, from Australia, worked to improve the [RNAsum R package](https://github.com/umccr/RNAsum), an RNA-seq reporting workflow designed to post-process, summarise, and visualize outputs. Sehrish worked on the package and a paper about it. [The package website](https://umccr.github.io/RNAsum/) present more information on the packages functionalities. Her mentor was [Emi Tanaka](/author/emi-tanaka/) from Australia. 

- **Jacqui Levy**, from Canada, worked on the [icicle package](https://github.com/Jacqui-123/icicle) to tidy and calculate ice cycle variables from thousands of open-source hydrological stations that are managed by the Water Survey of Canada. This R package will give scientists the tools to assess ice cycle variables and how they might be changing over time for any river station. Her mentor is [Jonathan Keane](/author/jonathan-keane/), from the US.

## Outreach Activities

Our Champions carried out a wide range of outreach activities like talks, conference papers, workshops, blog articles, community calls and meetups. The objective of these activities was to share what they did and learned during the program with their communities beyond rOpenSci.  

Outreach activities started in August 2024 involving local communities (universities, RUGs, R-Ladies Chapters, conferences, and organizations) and delivered in Champions’ native language (English, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese).

Members of this cohort worked together with champions from the first cohort to do theirs outreach activities and also introduce their cohort mates to other communities and organizations giving them space to share what they did during the champions program.

### Workshops

Paola Corrales developed and delivered an online workshop for non-selected applicants on [Git and GitHub](https://paocorrales.github.io/git-developing-software-together/) already giving back to the program. She will also teach this workshop for the second cohort.

### Community Calls and Coworking sessions



### R User Groups and R-Ladies meetups


### Talks and Blog post

Our Champions are part of other communities like R-Ladies, LatinR and local R User Groups, and organized several activities with these groups. 


## Champions' accomplishments and next steps

Our Champions have been very successful in the delivery of their projects, building high quality software with a focus on their countries and discipline. The impact of their work also spread to their home institutions and related local communities. Not only through their outreach activities sharing information and knowledge contextualized for their audience, but also by creating spaces for their local communities, like the R user groups, and through their research. 

Many of our Champions will continue with their outreach activities and mantaining their R package. Stay tuned to our events section in our website, our newsletter and social media to learn about them!
