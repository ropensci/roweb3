<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2022/12/16/ropensci-news-digest-december-2022).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

<!-- to be curated manually -->

### One-page HTML package manuals on R-universe and elsewhere with {postdoc}!

We have recently started building the reference manuals for each package r-universe: for packages that have had an update in the past 3 weeks, the reference manual is now linked from the package homepage on [r-universe.dev](https://r-universe.dev). All packages in in r-universe gets rebuilt at least once per month, so soon all packages should have the manual. 
You can also find [reference manuals for base-R packages](https://r-universe.dev/manuals/).

We released the three packages used creating these manuals: [postdoc](https://docs.ropensci.org/postdoc/), [katex](https://docs.ropensci.org/katex/) and [prismjs](https://docs.ropensci.org/prismjs/).

Find more information in our [tech note](/blog/2022/11/18/ropensci-news-digest-november-2022/).


### Meeting the stars of the R-Universe

Knowing our community's stories, to learn about the people behind our software brings us closer and offers us new opportunities. We introduce you to the rOpenSci interview series _"Meeting the stars of the R-Universe"_.

The first interview it is a bilingüal (Spanish & English) story starting in Latin America: The experience of working with R packages in the Argentine state. 

Don't miss the [blog post and the video](/blog/2022/11/23/r-universe-stars-1-en/) (with subtitles in English and Spanish).

### Coworking sessions continue!

Join us for social coworking & office hours monthly on first Tuesdays! 
Hosted by Steffi LaZerte and various community hosts. 
Everyone welcome. 
No RSVP needed. 
Consult our [Events](/events) page to find your local time and how to join.

* [Tuesday, Jan 10th, 14:00 European Central / 13:00 UTC](/events/coworking-2023-01/) "Working with new R users" *Hosted by community host [Alex Koiter](https://alexkoiter.ca) and [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/)*
    - Brainstorm ideas for supporting and encouraging new R users; Annotate a script for a friend or colleague to help them learn;
    - Talk to [Alex](https://alexkoiter.ca) and discuss how to share the love of R with new R users.

* [Tuesday, Feb 7th, 9:00 Americas Pacific / 17:00 UTC](/events/coworking-2023-02/) "Setting up Continuous Integration" *Hosted by community host [Hugo Gruson](/author/hugo-gruson/) and [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/)*
    - Do some reading to learn about Continuous Integration; Setup Continuous Integration on one (or more) of your projects;
    - Talk to [Hugo](/author/hugo-gruson/) and discuss how Continuous Integration can simplify your development process and how to get set up.

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!


## Software :package:

### New packages




The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [postdoc](https://docs.ropensci.org/postdoc), developed by Jeroen Ooms: Generates simple and beautiful one-page HTML reference manuals with package documentation. Math rendering and syntax highlighting are done server-side in R such that no JavaScript libraries are needed in the browser, which makes the documentation portable and fast to load.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=postdoc). 

+ [prismjs](https://docs.ropensci.org/prismjs), developed by Jeroen Ooms: Prism <https://prismjs.com/> is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter, built with modern web standards in mind. This package provides server-side rendering in R using V8 such that no JavaScript library is required in the resulting HTML documents. Over 400 languages are supported.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=prismjs).

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### What is a reproducible example for package development problems?

You might have heard of the reprex package, which we'd recommend using.
However, it's not necessarily adapted to _package development problems_.
To illustrate a problem you are having when developing a package, a reproducible example might consist in

* Creating an empty package, potentially with [`usethis::create_package()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_package.html);
* Adding as little elements as possible to it until you can illustrate the problem you have;
* Sharing it on a public platform (or a platform accessible to your target helper), potentially on GitHub with [`usethis::use_github()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github.html);
* Optionally, adding GitHub Actions workflows to it to have a log to show. See [`usethis::use_github_actions()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github_actions.html).

You do not need to use the usethis package.
However, it is crucial you find a way to quickly create the package skeleton and to quickly share it, as it will lessen the energy needed to get started, and leave you more time for the trickier reproducible example creation!

That's the kind of workflow recommended in [pkgdown contributing guide](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/CONTRIBUTING.html#package-reprexes).
It will serve you well in any package development Q&A channel.
Now, if you can't reduce your problem, hopefully you can show your actual package to someone, as opposed to describing it with words.

### How to distribute data with your package?

Because of size limitations on CRAN for instance, it might seem tricky to distribute data with your package.
You could publish it on [R-universe](https://ggseg.r-universe.dev/ui#packages), and also explore solutions presented in a [R-hub blog post](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/05/29/distribute-data/) and in a [posit community forum answer by Gábor Csárdi](https://community.rstudio.com/t/distributing-data-with-a-package/152848).
