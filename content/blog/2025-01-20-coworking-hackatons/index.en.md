This week we had a wonderful community call, [From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/first-time-contributor/).
This call was part of our [special series of activities](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/10/22/first-time-contributions/) to support first time contributors to rOpenSci packages.

In this post we summarize the call announce the next two activities, Coworking Mini-Hackathon for First-Time Contributors, to take place **February 4th 2025 1-3 UTC** and **March 4th 2025 13-15 UTC** (note that a sign up is required, [see below](#mini-hackthons) for details).

### Mini-Hackathons

If you're curious about contributing to Open Source Software, and would like some support to get started, these events are for you!

We'll be hosting two events, the first on **February 4th 2025 1-3 UTC** and the second on **March 4th 2025 13-15 UTC**.

During these session you'll join others making contributions to R packages while [package maintainers and other mentors](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/10/22/first-time-contributions/) are available 'live' to answer questions and give guidance.

We'll also have a special Slack channel ready as a place for asynchronous questions during the event and in the week following.

These collaborative events are designed to help first-time contributors get started with open-source projects.
Whether you're improving documentation, reviewing translations, fixing bugs, or adding new features, our mentors will guide you every step of the way.

**No prior experience required. Non-first time contributors are very welcome tooâ€”just bring your curiosity and enthusiasm!**

Note that this event requires registration.
Please fill out this [short form](https://airtable.com/appRpJelSoXWcYCG1/pagXLEueuI2o3GuBQ/form) to sign up.

We'll send out reminders, some information to get you started, and a Zoom link closer to the date.
