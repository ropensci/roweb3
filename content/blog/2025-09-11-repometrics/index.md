  We at rOpenSci are developing an organizational dashboard to provide an overview of all rOpenSci code contributors and their repositories.
  We are seeking feedback and suggestions on an initial [prototype dashboard](https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/repometrics-demo/).

We have developed an initial [prototype organizational dashboard](https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/repometrics-demo/), providing insights into code contributors and their repositories, primarily in that instance for the three related GitHub organizations, [reconhub](https://github.com/reconhub), [epiverse](https://github.com/epiverse), and [epiverse-trace](https://github.com/epiverse-trace). 
These three organizations host open-source software for understanding and analysing epidemics.
We aim to develop the current prototype as both an organization-wide dashboard for rOpenSci, and also as a template for adoption and adaptation by other open-source organizations.

## Help design and develop our dashboard

We are seeking help in the further design and development of our [prototype organizational dashboard](https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/repometrics-demo/).
The primary aim is to help all people involved with, or interested in, rOpenSci, through providing an organization-wide overview of the state of our code repositories and of the community activity which sustains them.

## How to help?

Please help us by providing suggestions for any ways you think the [prototype organizational dashboard](https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/repometrics-demo/) could be improved.
If you're a contributor to, or maintainer of, an R package, we'd particularly like to hear about any ways the dashboard could be made more useful for you.
Please make comments either directly here, or via either [issues](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/orgmetrics/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/orgmetrics/discussions/) in the [associated GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/orgmetrics).
Read or search through existing issues or discussions first, to see whether your ideas have already been discussed, and then either start a new issue or discussion, or comment on existing ones.
Want to give private feedback?
No worries, email <mark@ropensci.org> directly, or if you happen to be a member of our slack group, send me a private message.
