<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/07/23/ropensci-news-digest-july-2021).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

<!-- to be curated manually -->

Great news for fans of statistics and software!
rOpenSci's peer-review system has now [expanded](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/07/15/expanding-software-review/) to include review of packages implementing statistical routines and algorithms.
We are thrilled to start this new chapter, for which we've developed a series of new standards and tools, and recruited a new [board of experts](/stat-software-review/) to oversee.
Authors of statistical software should begin by reading the [*Stats Software Dev Guide*](https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org), which describes the categories of statistical software we now accept (Regression, Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and more!), along with the procedures for preparing statistical software for peer review.
It also introduces our automation tools, such as [the `pkgcheck` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/), which confirms that statistical software is ready to be submitted for review.
Authors submitting statistical software to review should start by opening a _pre-submission inquiry_ on our main [software review repository](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review).
Inquiries are welcome well before packages are ready for submittal.
We hope authors make use of our standards and tools throughout the development process so as to make review straightforward.
To volunteer as a _reviewer_, fill our [short form](/software-reviewer).
For any question, you can post on the [rOpenSci forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/statistical-software-peer-review/28) or contact the statistical software team (Mark Padgham, mark\<at\>ropensci.org, and Noam Ross, ross\<at\>ecohealthalliance.org).

On another topic, if you find yourself with more time for learning this summer, why not dig into the [rOpenSci community calls archive](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/)?
Every topic comes with a 1-hour video, speakers' slides, links to related resources, and a document with questions and answers from participants.
As of March 2020, video recordings have closed captions.

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [awardFindR](https://docs.ropensci.org/awardFindR), developed by Michael McCall: Queries a number of scientific awards databases. Collects relevant results based on keyword and date parameters, returns list of projects that fit those criteria as a data frame. Sources include: Arnold Ventures, Carnegie Corp, Federal RePORTER, Gates Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Mellon Foundation, NEH, NIH, NSF, Open Philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, Rockefeller Foundation, Russell Sage Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Sloan Foundation, Social Science Research Council, John Templeton Foundation, and USASpending.gov. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/432) by João Martins, Kara Woo.

+ [katex](https://docs.ropensci.org/katex), developed by Jeroen Ooms: Convert latex math expressions to HTML and MathML for use in markdown documents or package manual pages. The rendering is done in R using the V8 engine (i.e. server-side), which eliminates the need for embedding the MathJax library into your web pages. In addition a math-to-rd wrapper is provided to automatically render beautiful math in R documentation files.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=katex).

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### What R version to depend on?

What R version should your package support?
The rOpenSci development guide does not have any specific guidance for that (whereas e.g. the tidyverse policy is to [support the current version, the devel version, and four previous versions of R](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/r-version-support/)).
If you follow the Tidyverse example, then it'd make sense to _test_ your package in those R versions on [continuous integration](https://devguide.ropensci.org/ci.html).

Now if your choice of a recent R version as a minimal version stems from a newer base function, you might be interested in the [backports package](https://github.com/r-lib/backports) maintained by Michel Lang, that provides reimplementations of Functions Introduced Since R-3.0.0.
Its README explains how to use it [in packages](https://github.com/r-lib/backports#in-packages).
The README also has a list of the re-implementations, which is fun to look at for R history sake!

### Roles in package development & DESCRIPTION

It takes a village to... write an R package, or at least it can: creator, authors, reviewers, contributors, copyrightholders, etc.
In an R package DESCRIPTION you can use the [roles](https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html) found in `utils:::MARC_relator_db_codes_used_with_R`: aut, com, cph, cre, ctb, ctr, dtc, fnd, rev, ths, trl.
The current list of roles accepted for R packages are always listed in the output of `?person`.
The official recognition of the reviewer role is something rOpenSci [asked for](/blog/2018/03/16/thanking-reviewers-in-metadata/) and that we recommend in our [development guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#authorship).
We also advise pairing names with [ORCID IDs](/blog/2018/10/08/orcid/).

Now, how to easily re-use information from the DESCRIPTION file without copy-pasting it?
Enter the [desc package](https://github.com/r-lib/desc) by Gábor Csárdi, a tip shared by [Hao Ye](https://twitter.com/Hao_and_Y) in [rOpenSci semi-open slack](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels): you can use desc to synchronise information between DESCRIPTION and a [README.Rmd](https://github.com/uf-repro/lesson-template/blob/24418116992ab89bb68ec87d2fa454993b805fe0/README.Rmd#L27)!
This can be handy for package development, but also off-the-label use of package development tooling for e.g. [lesson development using pkgdown](https://github.com/uf-repro/lesson-template).
