This is the first post of our interview series __"Meeting the stars of the R-universe"__. We begin our journey in _Argentina_  with a team that uses R and develops R packages in the Argentinean State.


## Working with R packages in the Argentinian state

Two years ago, [Juan Pablo Ruiz Nicolini](https://twitter.com/TuQmano) (also known as _Tucu_) was invited to join the Markets and Statistics Department of the National Ministry of Sports and Tourism, headed by Matías Lammens. As part of this work, Juan Pablo leads a team that handles large volumes of data and the possibility of using it for multiple purposes. For these reasons, Juan Pablo and his team rely heavily on R and the R community for their work.

The team is large in comparison with other similar government agencies and with permanent large-scale projects such as those developed in conjunction with INDEC (National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina).

_“There is a large amount of work and information available and when we started our review we found that there was a lot of great stuff, a lot of data, a lot of processes.(...) there was a lot of room to take advantage of all the information that was living inside the computers of the teams working in our office.”_, This is how Juan Pablo explains the challenge and the opportunity that joining this office represented. The idea was also to be able to share all the information externally and with accessible processes for different audiences.


From the beginning, the process involved several steps. First they made the decision that R packages and open source software were the way to go. Then came the internal training stage. 

[Pablo Tiscornia](https://twitter.com/pabblo_h) is part of Juan Pablo's team or _el Tucu_ -that's how Juan Pablo Ruiz Nicolini is known- and explains that the starting point of their working is use everything that the R community had been offering and the free software philosophy.  Until now the work in the office combined manual processes and almost everything was in proprietary software. Pablo and Tucu met with a team of approximately 17 people who worked in some way with data processing and who were all very involved with the processes: _“first we needed to solve an internal work dynamic (...) there was a lot to do. Today I think out of those 17 people 15, 14 all of them know how to open R, they know how to put together a script and they know how they want to be involved in the process we define. From the moment you have a piece of data until you communicate at the end.”_

At this stage, the objective was achieved: the team learn the tool and the work dynamics that they had defined as the most appropriate.

The second step was to _"open the process"_ as well as _"improve the workflow"_. Pablo explains that they also incorporated the _"dynamics of an open State, open our process, not hiding how we do our work."_. A concept that in the future will also include the possibility of receiving contributions from the community and or our code to be reviewed.

As all processes are complex and many of them involve simultaneous and even "chaotic" steps, as _Tucu_ describes, where different people with diverse knowledge contributed to the design of the projects that are currently under development.

_Tucu_ gives as an example the _Thursday meeting_ where they show and share their codes so that other people can use them in other parts of the process: _"We do live coding where we raise doubts and do exercises (...) we try to generate a dynamic in which we share in a ludic way, sometimes showing each part and what they are doing to be shared with others."_


## Free software and in our language

In addition to the free nature of open source software and the importance of resource management for a State, Pablo Tiscornia explains what appears almost as a declaration of principles: _“It is a work philosophy, and an idea about how we develop and promote knowledge. I think what we can give, today to the State, is thanks to free software. So, it would be almost irresponsible not to promote what formed us.”_

Juan Pablo reinforces the idea with his personal experience: _“I was a master's thesis student in political science and seven years ago I forced myself to do my thesis in R in order to learn (...) and what I quickly found, luckily, was the R community.”._
> "and what I quickly found, luckily, was the R community"
__Exchanging with the community and learning from the community seems to be the main mantra of the R community that both Tucu and Pablo share with the team.__


## A work for the community

The audiences that receive the work developed in the office are multiple.

Today they have a site called [SINTA (Sistema de Información Turístico de la Argentina)](https://www.yvera.tur.ar/sinta/) where they present in an orderly fashion the _"different ways of accessing information"_. Juan Pablo explains that _"the work was to develop tools. R has much to do with this, bringing the information closer to different audiences"_.

Those audiences include academics (people who research and teach) and government. So, for example, different offices at different levels of the State need the data, and the office they work for that uses the information for decision-making and public policy setting. Also, all the people that want to interact with the information in the open data portal.

## The R-universe experience

The concept of community is closely related to social and communication networks, and it was precisely Twitter that first brought Juan Pablo closer to [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/) where he discovered [the step-by-step on how to build his own R universe.](/blog/2021/09/21/creando-tu-r-universe/).

_“It is the logical next place to share the things that we're doing openly, to make the packages in our GitHub available. It is possible to open up our little marketplace,our mini CRAN, in R-Universe, to share the libraries that we're starting to develop.”_, this is how the _Tucu_ explains the first use of the platform and adds: _“to me it looks spectacular, as I see how it is changing over time, how comprehensive it is, the way one can visualize all the development that one is sharing in the R-Universe”_.

Pablo adds that developing packages was the logical next step of the process after the training and the incorporation of the R language in the office: _“we put together, on the one hand, the toolswith which we improve our workflow, the package {Herramientas}, and on the other hand, the package {Comunicación}, that the idea was mainly, and still is today, mainly to improve the workflow of our team, our day-to-day work.”_.

They also add two important objectives to the whole process: to smooth the language and make it accessible to all people, even those who do not necessarily come from programming backgrounds, and to _"develop the packages in Spanish as much as possible”_. The target was the same: _We couldn't get into thinking whether we know English, if we don't know English, or even how much English we know. We wanted to get that barrier out of the way._

{{< figure src = "dnme-r-universe.png" class = "pull-right" width = "500" alt = "Screenshot of an R-Universe profile showing SINTA's packages" >}}


Both Pablo and Juan Pablo agree that the main potential of R-universe for the office is _being able to host all the packages they have under development._ Pablo defines it like this: _“So it seems to me that the main use I see today, a priori, is to be a great place where we can put all of our toolboxes and we can even show our packages as well. [We have a place with our tools that are consistent with each other, that has a common philosophy of work](https://dnme-minturdep.r-universe.dev/ui#packages)”_.

The work of Juan Pablo and Pablo as well as that of R-universe are inscribed in a world that has changed its structures and as they define it in the talk. In Pablo's words: _“We are in a world where programming is no longer for programmers in terms of who studied for it, we are in a world where there are many people who collaborate and want to collaborate even with only one little piece.”_.

Juan Pablo concludes by saying: _“There are more barriers that can be lowered, especially for those of us who do not come from programming, we come from the social sciences and began to program and started using tools that made our work easier. There is an instance to facilitate even more the work that we can write with the tidy philosophy with its manifesto and that "we can also do it in Spanish."_.
