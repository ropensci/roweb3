Can you think of an rOpenSci community member that you'd like to thank?

- A reviewer who helped your package be that much more awesome?
- Someone who answered your question? 
- A community call speaker from whom you gained insight?
- Someone who encouraged you behind the scenes?

Consider leaving them a note in the comments below expressing your gratitude. 
We often *think* our thank yous, but *expressing* thank yous can be incredibly meaningful.

On that note, we also want to take a moment to say **thank you**, to YOU.
Thank you so much for making the rOpenSci community that much more awesome.

Although it's been another hard year across the globe, this community has continued to 
contribute.

We've had 20(!) packages successfully complete [software peer review](/software-review/)[^1] 
with the help of XXX [reviewers](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html#reviewers) including several new [Editors](/about/#team). 

Many people contributed code or documentation (similar to last year, 85 people made their first code contribution to rOpenSci this year!); others shared [use cases](/usecases/) (88 new ones!) to help package authors see how their work is being used and help other users imagine how they can apply it.

Our [blog](/archive/) has benefited from the voices of many different authors (34 community member authors, including 13 first-time authors), 
and the same can be said of for our [Community Calls](/commcalls/) (XXX people in XXX countries).


> **Following is pretty much the same as last year...NEEDS UPDATING**

Others have cited our software (XXX [citations](/citations/) of XXX [packages](/packages/all/)), asked or answered questions, commented on project ideas, added notes to a public doc, invited us to talk about our work, or gave us a shoutout in a presentation, a post, or on Twitter.
