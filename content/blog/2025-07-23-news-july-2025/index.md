Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup! <!-- blabla --> You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2025/07/23/news-july-2025). Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Open Science with a Latin American Identity: Meet the New Cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program

We're very excited to introduce the new rOpenSci [Champions](/champions)! This cohort will participate in the program and carry out their work in Spanish, allowing us to continue strengthening the open science and research software development community in this language. We're excited about the projects they'll be developing, which tackle real-world challenges across diverse disciplines and regions of Latin America.

Read all about the new champions and their projects in our [blog post](/blog/2025/07/03/champions-2025/).

## Calls for contributions

### Calls for maintainers

If you're interested in maintaining any of the R packages below, you might enjoy reading our blog post [What Does It Mean to Maintain a Package?](/blog/2023/02/07/what-does-it-mean-to-maintain-a-package/).

-   [USAboundaries](https://docs.ropensci.org/USAboundaries/) (and USAboundariesdata), historical and contemporary boundaries of the United States of America. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci/USAboundaries/issues/50).

### Calls for contributions

Refer to our [help wanted page](/help-wanted/) -- before opening a PR, we recommend asking in the issue whether help is still needed.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Feedback wanted! CRAN Task View proposal for "Package Development and Maintenance"

Sharing a request by Heather Turner and Lluís Revilla.

There is a new CRAN Task View [proposal](https://github.com/hturner/pkg-dev-ctv/blob/main/proposal.md) for "Package Development and Maintenance". The people behind it and the CRAN task View editorial team are looking for feedback. If creating a package and maintaining it is intimidating we are looking for your opinion (to avoid the ["curse of knowledge"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)):

-   Does it have most of the information you need to accomplish all the steps till your package is released?
-   Do you know which tools and package can help you maintain the package working ?
-   Is there any topic or step we missed or after reading the relevant section you still don't feel confident on how to do it?

Read the [proposal](https://github.com/hturner/pkg-dev-ctv/blob/main/proposal.md). Please send your feedback directly in [the repository](https://github.com/hturner/pkg-dev-ctv/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) or send the feedback through private channels to [Lluís Revilla](https://llrs.dev) (email, Slack, ...)

### Cache values with automatic pruning: the cachem package

If you're writing a wrapper for an API that has no regular caching headers, you might be interested in the [cachem package](https://github.com/r-lib/cachem/) for caching. Thanks to Tan Ho and Pieter Huybrechts for the tip. See its use in [comtradr](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/blob/f5b2715bf6dddcaff039c3613e8f4ecb0607e5c0/R/zzz.R#L58) by Paul Bochtler.

### A debugging tip

Miles McBain shared an interesting debugging tip in his post [Dive()ing into the hunt #rstats](https://milesmcbain.micro.blog/2025/07/04/diveing-into-the-hunt-rstats.html).

### How to prepare examples in your package for a CRAN submission

The CRAN cookbook by Jasmine Daly and Beni Altmann features a section called ["Structuring of Examples"](https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/general_issues.html#structuring-of-examples) mentioning dontrun and friends and their use cases. Thanks to Hugo Gruson for the find!

### Don't ask "any updates on this?" on GitHub

Carlos Scheidegger, a developer of Quarto, wrote an interesting [Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/cscheid.net/post/3ls25wg6mnk2y) about why it's not considerate to write "any update on this?" on open bug reports or feature requests.

> 'But "any updates?" just makes everyone feel bad.''

### LLLM helpers: the chores package

The [chores package](https://simonpcouch.github.io/chores/index.html) by Simon Couch provides LLM helpers for tasks that are hard to automate, like converting your messages to using the cli R package. Its thoughtful documentation includes guidance on [creating your own helpers](https://simonpcouch.github.io/chores/articles/custom.html).

### LLM tools for R

Speaking of LLM tooling in R, Luis D. Verde Arregoitia maintains an [extensive guide](https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/).
