Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup! <!-- blabla --> You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2025/07/23/news-july-2025). Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

### Open Science with a Latin American Identity: Meet the New Cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program

We're very excited to introduce the new rOpenSci [Champions](/champions)! This cohort will participate in the program and carry out their work in Spanish, allowing us to continue strengthening the open science and research software development community in this language. We're excited about the projects they'll be developing, which tackle real-world challenges across diverse disciplines and regions of Latin America.

Read all about the new Champions and their projects in our [blog post](/blog/2025/07/03/champions-2025/).

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Feedback wanted! CRAN Task View proposal for "Package Development and Maintenance"

Sharing a request by Heather Turner and Lluís Revilla.

There is a new CRAN Task View [proposal](https://github.com/hturner/pkg-dev-ctv/blob/main/proposal.md) for "Package Development and Maintenance". This task view lists and comments on packages useful for package development and maintenance. The authors and the CRAN task View editorial team are looking for feedback. In particular, they'd especially like your feedback if you're new to package development or find the idea of creating and maintaining a package intimidating (to avoid the ["curse of knowledge"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)).

Regarding this task view, they'd like to know:

-   Does it have most of the information you need to accomplish all the steps through development until your package is released?
-   Does this help you understand which tools and packages can help you maintain your package working ?
-   Is there any topic or step we missed? Or after reading the relevant topic section you still don't feel confident on how to do it?

Read the [proposal](https://github.com/hturner/pkg-dev-ctv/blob/main/proposal.md). Please submit your feedback directly in [the repository](https://github.com/hturner/pkg-dev-ctv/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) or send the feedback through private channels to [Lluís Revilla](https://llrs.dev) (email, Slack, ...)

### Cache values with automatic pruning: the cachem package

If you're writing a wrapper for an API that has no regular caching headers, you might be interested in the [cachem package](https://github.com/r-lib/cachem/) for caching. Thanks to Tan Ho and Pieter Huybrechts for the tip. See its use in [comtradr](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/blob/f5b2715bf6dddcaff039c3613e8f4ecb0607e5c0/R/zzz.R#L58) by Paul Bochtler.

### A debugging tip

Miles McBain shared an interesting debugging tip in his post [Dive()ing into the hunt #rstats](https://milesmcbain.micro.blog/2025/07/04/diveing-into-the-hunt-rstats.html), using a custom function to implement something like a 'row-wise data debug' mode!

### How to prepare examples in your package for a CRAN submission

The CRAN cookbook by Jasmine Daly and Beni Altmann features a section called ["Structuring of Examples"](https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/general_issues.html#structuring-of-examples) mentioning dontrun and friends and their use cases. Thanks to Hugo Gruson for the find!

### Don't ask "any updates on this?" on GitHub

Carlos Scheidegger, a developer of Quarto, wrote an interesting [Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/cscheid.net/post/3ls25wg6mnk2y) about why it's not considerate to write "any update on this?" on open bug reports or feature requests.

Carlos suggests that better alternatives are to "add *new* information to the post about how you want to use it, or other workarounds" which might give developers ideas for different fixes, or to simply upvote the request. But avoid "any updates?", which is hard on the developer because all they can say is "no", and they know that will disappoint people.

### LLLM helpers: the chores package

The [chores package](https://simonpcouch.github.io/chores/index.html) by Simon Couch provides LLM helpers for tasks that are hard to automate, like converting your messages to using the cli R package. Its thoughtful documentation includes guidance on [creating your own helpers](https://simonpcouch.github.io/chores/articles/custom.html).

### LLM tools for R

Speaking of LLM tooling in R, Luis D. Verde Arregoitia maintains an [extensive guide](https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/).
