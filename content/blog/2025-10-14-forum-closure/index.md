We have maintained a public discussion forum on Discourse for years.
Because of its low use and our lack of resources to invest in its promotion and moderation,
we have decided to close `discuss.ropensci.org`.

Now, we still care about public discussion!
You are still welcome to participate in the issues and discussions in source repositories of the packages and projects you use.
You can also use our [contributing guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) to find ways to get involved with our community, be it participating in a community call or coworking session, sending contributions to a package, tagging our Mastodon account, etc.

We look forward to engaging with you all in our remaining, strong, online spaces!
