## rOpenSci seeks mentors to support our inaugural cohort of rOpenSci Champions.


The [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) is for _people from historically and systematically excluded groups_ who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader ecosystem of open source and open science communities. After receiving training, mentors will work with Champions to develop their project, which can be one of the following options:

* Create a new package

* Go through the review process with an R package they already have developed

* Serve as a reviewer for the rOpenSci  software peer review system

Mentors may also support Champions with delivering other activities including; giving a talk, writing blog posts, and teaching other community members.

### Role Description

Mentors will play a vital role in the rOpenSci champions program by selecting the first cohort of Champions and advising and inspiring their mentees. Mentors will also __connect__ their mentees to people, programs, organizations; __recommend__, resources, readings, training, experiences and provide __feedback__ about the mentee's project.

We are seeking Mentors who are rOpenSci community members who have:

* Demonstrated an understanding and ability to work openly and collaboratively

* The willingness to guide and teach others

* Previous experience with any of the following: 

  * Developing, maintaining or contributing to any of our packages or the packages we review, or
  
  * Participating in the rOpenSci review process, or 
  
  * Package development and/or peer code review

Mentors will gain tutoring experience and skills, be acknowledged on the rOpenSci website and social media channels, and make new connections across the champions networks. This is a great way to give back to the rOpenSci community by mentoring our selected champions and helping to shape this program by providing feedback on this pilot year.
