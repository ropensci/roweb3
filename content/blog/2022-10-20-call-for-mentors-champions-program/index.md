## rOpenSci is seeking mentors to support our inaugural cohort of rOpenSci Champions!


The [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) is for _people from historically and systematically excluded groups_ who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader ecosystem of open source and open science communities. After receiving training, mentors will work with Champions to develop their project, which can be one of the following options:

* Create a new package;

* Go through the review process with an R package they have already developed;

* Serve as a reviewer for the rOpenSci software peer review system.

Mentors may also support Champions with delivering other activities including: giving a talk, writing blog posts, and teaching other community members.

### Role description

Mentors will play a vital role in the rOpenSci Champions Program by helping select the [first cohort of Champions](/blog/2022/09/22/launch-champions-program/#how-to-apply) and advising and inspiring their mentees. Mentors will also __connect__ their mentees to people, programs, and organizations; __recommend__, resources, readings, training, and experiences; and provide __feedback__ on the mentee's project.

We are seeking mentors from the rOpenSci community who have:

* Demonstrated an understanding and ability to work openly and collaboratively;

* The willingness to guide and teach others;

* Previous experience with any of the following: 

  * Developing, maintaining or contributing to any rOpenSci package or package which has gone through rOpenSci review, or
  
  * Participating in the rOpenSci review process, or 
  
  * Package development and/or peer code review.

Mentors will gain mentoring experience and skills, be acknowledged on the rOpenSci website and social media channels, and make new connections across the Champions' networks. By mentoring our selected Champions and helping to shape this program by providing feedback on this pilot year, mentors will also be giving back to the rOpenSci community in a great and meaningful way!

### Expectations

The total time commitment is expected to be approximately 1-2 hours per month from November 2022 - December 2023 to complete the following tentative program timeline.
