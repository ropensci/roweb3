A new post of our interview series [“Meeting the stars of the R-universe”](/tags/r-universe-stars/). We aim to introduce the teams and people behind the development of software and packages many of us use and which are available through the R-Universe. We want to highlight and explore different teams and projects around the world, the work they do, their processes and users. This stop is at the __United Kingdom__ to talk with members of the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. Be sure to watch the video at the end with excerpts from the interview.


_Infectious diseases continue to generate multiple problems in human health. The pandemic experience taught us the importance of research to fight epidemics. Today we will meet a team of developers who use the R-Universe to host packages that help in this work._

The chat begins with [Rich FitzJohn](/author/rich-fitzjohn/), who leads the research software engineering team at the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis). This center works on the global analysis of infectious diseases. It is a center for research and development of tools for epidemiological analysis and modeling of infectious diseases to collaborate with the work of national and international agencies to plan public policy responses to potential infectious disease threats.

This team was one of the first to use our R-Universe and we're interested in understanding and sharing their reasons for joining the platform.

As Rich explains, their work consists of providing answers to general and specific epidemiology problems and responding to more than 200 different companies. Within this framework, they use the R-Universe as a way to distribute and present packages they develop and use in their work.

In this sense, Rob, a software engineer who works with John, adds that the packages allow them to deliver the work to all the users in a simple, useful, and responsible way. Especially if you consider that it is very collaborative work and many times against the clock. That is why they try to be all working at the same time on the same code with a permanent development and revision cycle to meet the needs of the researchers.
This development can then be used by researchers worldwide, and that is where R-Universe becomes a fundamental tool.

Multiple users can access the [MRC universe](https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev) to use the packages and have the necessary material available to develop some type of research. However, it is likely that they will need some training or knowledge to be able to use them because of the level of specificity. R-Universe is also a place to see what scientists are studying and developing because they also use the platform to upload their packages and find other packages to use in their research. 

Recalling how they first entered the R-universe, Rich says it was by being invited to try out a new project that rOpenSci was working on. They then quickly realized that it represented the possibility of saving hours of work in different tasks. Over time the features and functionalities of the R-Universe changed and expanded as the project matured.

It was at this point in the talk that they discussed possible future features that could be useful in R-Universe; from archiving different versions of the binaries of each package according to a researcher's reproducibility needs, to automatic generation of package documentation, to different ideas for increasing R-Universe's package search and discovery capabilities.

Some of these challenges are under development and R-Universe already has features that respond to these ideas from Rich and Rob's team. For example: [Downloading snapshots and creating stable R packages repositories using r-universe](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/05/31/runiverse-snapshots/) and [Discovering and learning everything there is to know about R packages using r-universe](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/02/27/runiverse-discovering/).


In the following video, Rich and Rob share more details of their work in the MRC and share in the rOpenSci R-Universe.
