On July 21, during the CSIDNet Annual General Meeting 2025,  Yanina Bellini Saibene and Samuel Schildhauer co-lead a session titled **“Open Science, R Packages, and Research Software Development”**. The session was designed not only to introduce participants to tools and practices in open science with R but also to encourage active reflection and discussion on their own workflows and the challenges they face.

## Kicking Things Off: The Human Barometer

To break the ice and get people moving and thinking we use a [well known method at rOpenSci unconf called the Human Barometer](/blog/2018/11/01/icebreaker/). Participants physically positioned themselves along a line in response to a series of light-hearted and thought-provoking prompts, such as:

1. Cats or Dogs?
2. I practice open science in my activity.
3. I use R in my research.

Participants then discussed their positions and tried to convince the other group to change their minds. This dynamic approach not only brought energy into the room but also offered a quick glimpse into the community's practices and perspectives, giving the participants the chance to become acquainted interactively.
