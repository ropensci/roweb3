When GitHub announced [support for CITATION.cff
files](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1420122675813441540) I though on
creating a package that would assist R developers on this matter. I was already
using [codemetar](https://docs.ropensci.org/codemetar/) on most of my packages,
so I was familiar with the creation of this kind of metadata files.

I borrowed some ideas from codemetar, although I decided to create most of my
code from scratch (I enjoy challenging myself, and there is not better way for
learning). Finally, the first working version of
[cffr](https://docs.ropensci.org/cffr/) was released on September 15, 2021.

## The challenge

One of the things I had always in mind is that cffr should be able to work with
any R package, no matter if it was available on CRAN, Bioconductor, the
[r-universe](/r-universe/) or exclusively on GitHub/GitLab. So when I finished
the initial version, I needed to test it with the largest possible number of
packages.

I started setting up a testthat [^1] test [on a separated
folder](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr/blob/main/tests/testthat/test_ci/test-full_cff.R),
that I ignored on .Rbuildignore. This test is basically a
[loop](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr/blob/6260303668303010c0c90ff381518960299a18f0/tests/testthat/test_ci/test-full_cff.R#L35:L61)
over [all the R packages installed
locally](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr/blob/6260303668303010c0c90ff381518960299a18f0/tests/testthat/test_ci/test-full_cff.R#L4:L7)
, where I create the corresponding `cff` object for each package and validate
it. Finally, the test creates a [small report in
Markdown](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr/blob/6260303668303010c0c90ff381518960299a18f0/tests/testthat/test_ci/test-full_cff.R#L64:L100)
with the summary of the results.

[^1]: Wickham H (2011). "testthat: Get Started with Testing." *The R Journal*,
    **3**, 5--10.
    <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf>.

This setup was fine and worked locally, I just needed to run:

``` r
# Load package
devtools::load_all()
          
# Run the tests
testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat/test_ci")
```

And voil√†! The Markdown report is created on
`tests/testthat/test_ci/_snaps/full_cff.md`.

However I was not completely comfortable with this setup. Locally, I have
installed \~200 packages, and it seemed to me like a small sample (CRAN hosts
more than 18,300 packages), so I needed to enlarge that sample. Also, I didn't
want to install more packages on my computer just for testing, so the question
was: **how to achieve this?**

## The solution: Continuous Integration

The alternative approach seemed pretty obvious: using CI with GitHub Actions. So
basically I created [this
workflow](https://github.com/ropensci/cffr/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-ci.yaml)
integrating the previous script[^2].

[^2]: The workflow is derived from
    [r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples).

But still there were some open questions, as: **how to select a meaningful
sample of R packages?**

### Initial steps

The action
[`r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/setup-r-dependencies)
was already included on my workflow, so I started using the `extra-packages`
option and installing the tidyverse and tidymodels. I decided to start with
these two packages as they also import some of the most popular R packages.
Also, extra points for `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies` as it uses caching
for the installed packages, meaning that subsequent deploys would be
significantly faster.

So it was a good start in my quest to test cffr on a large sample of packages,
but I was not still there...

### Working with CRAN Task Views

Do you know [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)? This is an
useful collection of packages classified by relevant topics. With the ctv
package[^3], it is quite straightforward to install the packages included on
each of those views. I decided then to install the core packages of all views,
in order to increase my package sample:

[^3]: Zeileis A (2005). "CRAN Task Views." *R News*, **5**(1), pp. 39--40.
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/Rnews/>

``` r
# Install core packages of all views
options(repos = c(
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))

allviews <- ctv::available.views()
packs <- lapply(seq_len(length(allviews)), function(x) {
  allviews[[x]]$packagelist
})

packs <- dplyr::bind_rows(packs)
core <- dplyr::filter(packs, core == TRUE)
```

For information, all the packages included on the CRAN Task Views are **4,276**
(on the `packs` object). The core packages (the ones I selected on the `core`
object) are **286** packages.

### Increasing the number with the r-universe

[r-universe](/r-universe/) by [Jeroen Ooms](/author/jeroen-ooms/) is a wonderful
project that, apart of the functionality of acting as a CRAN-like repo, includes
several other components. One of those components is a specific [API
Endpoint](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/ui#api) for every r-universe with some
very useful resources, as the ability of retrieving a [list of all the packages
included in each r-universe](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/packages)

This fits perfectly on my needs, so my next step was to retrieve packages of
selected r-universes:

-   [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/)

-   [R-lib](https://r-lib.r-universe.dev/)

-   [R-forge](https://r-forge.r-universe.dev/)

-   [R-Studio](https://rstudio.r-universe.dev/)

-   [rspatial](https://r-spatial.r-universe.dev/)

I selected this well-known organizations as they hosts also a lot of popular
packages among use**R**s. Also, my hope was that other developers would have
checked at some point the DESCRIPTION and the inst/CITATION of any of these
packages as the starting point for developing their own (as I usually do üòÅ), so
these packages could be considered representative enough.

Extracting a list of package of a r-universe is as easy as:

``` r
# rOpenSci packages from r-universe
ropensci <- unlist(jsonlite::read_json("https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/packages"))
ropenscireviewtools <- unlist(jsonlite::read_json("https://ropenscireviewtools.r-universe.dev/packages"))

# R-lib packages
rlib <- unlist(jsonlite::read_json("https://r-lib.r-universe.dev/packages"))

# R-forge packages
rforge <- unlist(jsonlite::read_json("https://r-forge.r-universe.dev/packages"))

# R-Studio packages
rstudio <- unlist(jsonlite::read_json("https://rstudio.r-universe.dev/packages"))

# rspatial packages
rspatial <- unlist(jsonlite::read_json("https://r-spatial.r-universe.dev/packages"))
```

And I joined all the retrieved packages on a single object `all`:

``` r
all <- sort(unique(c(core$name, ropensci, ropenscireviewtools, rlib, rforge, rstudio, rspatial)))
```

That makes a grand total of **925 packages**. At this point, I was quite happy
with the sample of packages, since it included a large set relevant packages.

## Final steps: installing the packages

I was almost there! Now, the last step was just to install these packages and
test them.

With the aim of improving the performance, I filtered out the packages already
installed on the system like this:

``` r
# Check packages not installed yet
instpack <- as.character(installed.packages()[, "Package"])
toinstall <- setdiff(all, instpack)
```

I decided also to install most of the packages directly from CRAN, except those
belonging to rOpenSci. For these packages, I decided to use the r-universe
server, so I would have a mix of CRAN and r-universe packages on my sample for
testing purposes:

The following script does that trick:

``` r
# Install
options(repos = c(
  ropensci = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev",
  ropenscireviewtools = "https://ropensci-review-tools.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))

install.packages(toinstall,
  dependencies = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE, quiet = TRUE,
  type = "binary"
)

# Update
update.packages(type = "binary")
```

Note that I installed the packages using `dependencies = TRUE"`. This forces the
installation of the packages on Depends, Imports and Suggest, so by doing this I
was increasing substantially the overall number of packages installed on my
GitHub Actions. Thanks to caching, on a regular run the previous process of
installing packages takes less than 4 minutes on GitHub that, in my opinion, is
more than satisfactory[^4].

[^4]: Note also the use of `type = "binary"`. The workflow runs on Windows and
    macOS, so in order to speed up the process I instructed to install the
    precompiled versions. For that very same reason, I didn't run this full test
    on Linux, since it would be necessary to compile every package from source.

Then, it was just a matter of running again the first chunk presented in the
post also in GitHub Actions:

``` r
# Load package
devtools::load_all()
          
# Run the tests
testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat/test_ci")
```

I created also a final step (named "Display results") that basically prints the
output of the Markdown report. The lasts bits were to include a scheduled run
via
[cron](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events)
and the use of the action
[`actions/upload-artifact@v2`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) for
updating the final report after each run.

See here an extract of the results of the last run:

## The result

At this stage, I was ready to check cffr with a broad number of packages. This
workflow has been really useful for detecting corner cases not initially covered
on the first release, so after several iterations now I feel comfortable with
the compatibility of cffr with a large number of representative R packages.

On subsequent runs (once the packages are cached) the whole workflow run takes
\~13 minutes on Windows and \~8 minutes on macOS. This allows me to rapidly test
any improvement of the package.

## Lessons learned

After validating the metadata of hundreds of packages, there are some thoughts
that I would like to share:

1.  cffr was able to produce valid `cff` object for **1,925 packages** out of
    1,930[^5]. I opened a couple of
    [pull](https://github.com/selva86/InformationValue/pull/5)
    [requests](https://github.com/ropensci/photosearcher/pull/13) on some of the
    failing packages were I saw a clear mistake on the metadata. So in some way
    this exercise could be used also to improve other packages by detecting
    typos, etc. on the metadata.

2.  The DESCRIPTION files are [pretty
    standardized](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file)
    and usually they are not a problem for cffr. However,
    [inst/CITATION](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#CITATION-files)
    are tricky (*Do you have a inst/CITATION? Do you still use
    [`citEntry()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/citEntry.html) instead of
    [`bibentry()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/bibentry.html)? Maybe you use `meta`
    information of your DESCRIPTION or you use
    [`citation(auto = meta)`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/citation.html)?*). This
    was the most difficult issue to solve when developing the package.

3.  There are differences between the accepted keys on `bibentry()`, BibTeX and
    the
    [`preferred-citation`](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md#preferred-citation)
    field of a CITATION.cff file. I tried to map those the best I can,
    suggestions welcomed!

[^5]: At the moment of writing, CRAN hosted **18,369 packages**, so the testing
    sample is \~10.5% of the overall number of packages in CRAN.

One thing I did after completing this process is to make use of the `bibentry()`
function instead of `citEntry()` on the inst/CITATION files of all my packages.
I chose this since the syntax is very similar to BibTeX, and the function
additionally provides guidance on the possible entry types, as well as specific
validity checks for each entry type.

And that's all! If you have any suggestion on how to improve the current
validation workflow, I would glad to include it on my checks.
