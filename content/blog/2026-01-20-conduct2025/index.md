rOpenSci’s activities and spaces are supported by a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) 
that applies to all people participating in the rOpenSci community, 
including rOpenSci staff and leadership.
It applies to all modes of interaction including GitHub project repositories, 
the rOpenSci discussion forum, Slack, Community Calls, Co-working and social sessions, training and mentoring sessions, 
and in person at rOpenSci-hosted events, including affiliated social gatherings.
Our Code of Conduct is developed and enforced by a committee including rOpenSci staff and an independent community member.

Here we report our annual review of rOpenSci's Code of Conduct, 
reporting process, and internal guidelines for handling reports and enforcement.

## Updates

1.  No changes of Committee members for 2026.
    The committee members are [Natalia Morandeira](/author/natalia-morandeira/) (independent member), 
    [Mark Padgham](/author/mark-padgham) (rOpenSci Software Research Scientist) and 
    [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene) (rOpenSci Community Manager).
    We are responsible for receiving, investigating, adjudicating, enforcing, 
    and responding to all reports of potential violations of our Code.

2.  No changes have been made to the text of the Code in English, Spanish or Portuguese.

Because the text has remained unchanged, the version number is kept at 2.5, dated January 30, 2024.

## Committee Members Activities

An important aspect of our work as Committee members is to make sure that the processes we follow are transparent, consistent, and fair. To support this work we’ve developed a set of templates that guide us through different stages of incident response and reporting. We shared openly these templates and explain them in detail in the [blog post "rOpenSci Code of Conduct Committee Templates"](https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/09/30/coc-templates/).

Yanina Bellini Saibene attended the Session "" at the CZI meeting to discuss Code of Conduct best practices with other like minded organizations in the Open Science movement.

We welcome your feedback by [email](mailto:conduct@ropensci.org) to conduct at ropensci.org, 
and we thank you for continuing to work with us to ensure that rOpenSci remains a safe, 
enjoyable, friendly and enriching environment for everyone who participates.
