This is our first story in our interview series **Stories of Champions**, where we introduce you to different Champions and the impact they have. Our first Champion is [Carolina Pradier](/es/author/carolina-pradier/), main maintainer of the eph package.

[Carolina Pradier](/es/author/carolina-pradier/) has long worked to make the world a more equitable place. Her doctoral research focused on inequalities in science with a focus on the mechanisms that structure gender inequality in the Latin American scientific community. She is also part of [Ecofeminita](https://ecofeminita.com/) -Asociación Civil Economía Feminista-, an interdisciplinary organization created and led by women.
Carolina has a degree in Economics from the University of Buenos Aires. She holds a Master's degree in Social Sciences of Work from the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires, a PhD in Information Science from the University of Montreal and teaches at the higher education level.

As a researcher, she was part of the Center for Studies on Population, Employment and Development and now works in the research team of [Open Science research team at UNESCO.](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science) She is *maintainer* from [R package 'eph'](https://docs.ropensci.org/eph/) package, whose objective is to facilitate the work with the Permanent Household Survey data.

## The rOpenSci

Their encounter with the rOpenSci Champion(e|a)s program seemed natural. Her goals and those of the organization were aligned. In her application to the Champion(e|a)s program Carolina expressed:

> I would like to be part of the rOpenSci Champions Program to improve my skills as a developer, as well as to improve my abilities to teach and communicate these skills."

And that happened over 12 months of training where through coaching and mentoring, Carolina received information on tools and processes to improve her package with individual mentoring and access to colleagues and R experts that helped improve her project. She was also able to develop her communication skills and feel more confident in communicating more effectively with the people who use eph.

The exchange and meeting with other people made her work easier, tidier and helped her to anticipate future problems she might encounter:

> I think I felt very good when we finished the training and I started to work closely with my mentor, we had a good relationship and we could work very well and efficiently."

Carolina was not only selected to participate in the rOpenSci Champions program. she had already gone through a previous selection: as the application to the program is individual it was her peers who encouraged her to participate on behalf of the team.

During the program, Carolina developed different events that contributed to disseminate her work, share it with others and invite them to approach open science. This idea was also present in the objectives that Carolina expressed in her first contact with rOpenSci:

> One of my main motivations is to bring new tools to the communities of social scientists in which I actively participate in order to strengthen our capacities to transform reality."

It was in this sense that Carolina [organized an event in Spanish](https://vimeo.com/899372049) with news and ideas for the use of its epa package, achieving a double objective: sharing content about R packages in Spanish and bringing more people closer to the community.
It also participated in a [Community Call on the rOpenSci Champions Program.](/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/) where he shared his experience together with mentor [Beatriz Milz](/es/author/beatriz-milz/) and his cohort partner, [Victor Ordu](/author/victor-ordu/).

## Perfecting a job well done

The [eph package](https://github.com/ropensci/eph/) package allows processing data from the Permanent Household Survey - INDEC, Argentina to replicate or obtain conclusions independent of those published in the reports prepared by the government agency. It also allows the analysis of different categories and indicators not provided in the official reports.
Carolina explained that throughout the program they managed to improve the package:

> "We tried to improve the quality of the code (reliability and efficiency), we improved the documentation and created new functions.

They also worked hard to translate the documentation and make it more accessible to all non-English speaking users.
During the peer review process of rOpenSci, [demonstrated that the way of working can be rigorous and warm at the same time.](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/593#issuecomment-1709968472)

{{< figure src = "revision.png" alt = "Comentario en el issue de revisión de eph: Antes que nada, felicitaciones por el paquete. Es un paquete sumamente útil para la comunidad y uno de los más importantes para aquellos que trabajan en política pública. Además de que es un ejemplo para otros organismos del estado de cómo se puede disponibilizar data que sea en servicio de la comunidad. Además, es una linda muestra de cómo se puede mejorar un proyecto con el tiempo y no sólo se sostiene en el mismo sino que está permanentemente creciendo." caption = "Comentario abierto, transparente y amigable de la revisión por pares en el proceso de rOpenSci del paquete eph">}}

## Open science

The package is a tool for academic research, journalism and evidence-based public policy formulation. The champions program allowed us to add quality, improve the software and add different points of view through peer and expert review.

Carolina is part of the civil association EcoFeminita where the Ecofemidata team provides data on gender inequality with indicators, statistics, and reproducible thematic reports based on the package. Among other uses, the Ecofemidata team maintains an app that analyzes the labor market, income, time use, and domestic work.
Once again it was able to meet another of the objectives set at the beginning of the rOpenSci program:

> I am particularly excited about the prospect of participating in a program aimed at making the R community more inclusive. in addition, I feel that this experience would be a great opportunity as it would allow me to meet and work with highly skilled professionals whose work I deeply admire. Not only am I interested in learning from their experience, but I also believe that building these networks can help increase the impact of my community's efforts and access new sources of support."

The package further inspired other programmers, data scientists, and people from different disciplines to develop in Python the [PyEPH library](https://pyeph.readthedocs.io/es/latest/) library, which has a similar purpose to the epa package in R, but to be used and supported by people in the Python data community.

## Beyond learning: building in community

Carolina Pradier was able to learn about R, sort her knowledge, acquire new skills and offer a multilingual package so that more people can access open science. The contact with her mentor, with her peers, with the people who participated in the review process and the people who use the package was a great contribution to learning and personal growth. Her participation in the Champions Program was the beginning of a network of links that promise new projects.

> I always had someone to talk to to help me solve problems; it was never a frustrating process."

was Carolina's response to the question about possible improvements to be made to the Campeones y Campeonas program, and she added:

> I think the team is very well organized to help you. During the training I got a lot of information on how to solve the problems that I could encounter".

Shared knowledge allows us to anticipate, help and include. The more experiences like Carolina Pradier's we can have the more shared open science there will be.
