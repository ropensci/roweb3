Are you [the mother goat or the wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_and_the_Seven_Young_Goats)?
Consumers of your online content might care!
Be it on social media or other platforms, your profile can sometimes be "verified".
What does it mean? How does one get a green checkmark where it matters?
Here's a primer on domain verification.

## A basic verification workflow

Say you, Jane Doe, have your resume and a blog on a website, janedoe.com.
You also publish content on another site, for instance Mastodon.
How do readers of Mastodon ensure they're reading content by "Jane Doe from janedoe.com" and not a malicious impersonator?
Well, you can _verify_ the domain of janedoe.com on Mastodon.

The platform for this second website (Mastodon in our example here) will ask you to publish something on the domain you own (or have access to, here janedoe.com) which proves that you are the same person.
You will go and publish it, then ask Mastodon to query janedoe.com to check you did.
If Mastodon finds what it asked for on janedoe.com, it can put a green check mark near the domain of janedoe.org on your Mastodon profile.
Readers now know you are the same person on both sites!

## An example: Mastodon

Below is the [Mastodon profile](https://ecoevo.social/@noamross) of rOpenSci director Noam Ross, that features a few URLs including `ropensci.org/about` highlighted in green. 
That URL is _verified_.

{{< figure src="noam.png" alt="" >}}

In clear text on our [about page](/about/) you can read that Noam is rOpenSci's executive director indeed, but that's not what Mastodon uses to assess whether `ropensci.org/about` represents Noam in some way.
Mastodon uses this metadata field in the head of the website:

```html
<a rel=me href=https://ecoevo.social/@noamross><img src=/images/users/mastodon.svg alt style=max-width:16px;max-height:16px></a>
```

After we added that field to the website, Noam went to his Mastodon profile settings to add the URL which triggered a query from Mastodon to `ropensci.org/about`.
Mastodon found this field in the web page, and was able to verify the URL.

This DIY verification is actually one of [Mastodon's selling points](https://joinmastodon.org/verification), as it doesn't rely on some arbitrary measure of popularity or importance, just on logic.

## Another example: GitHub

Below is the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ropensci) of rOpenSci, that features a green "verified" badge as well as the URL to our website. 
That URL is _verified_.

{{< figure src="ropensci.png" alt="" >}}

In this case, in the GitHub [settings](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-organization) we were asked to publish a _DNS TXT record_ with a given name and given content. Think `blabla-identity-challenge-ropensci-github.ropensci.org` with `random-characters` as content.

We created that record in the dashboard of our DNS provider, then asked GitHub to query the record.
It can take a little while for the DNS record to be online for real, but in our case it was more or less instantaneous.

It is possible to have several GitHub organizations point to the same website, all with a green "verified" badge.
You simply have to do the domain verification once per GitHub organization.
See for instance our [ropenscilabs](https://github.com/ropenscilabs) and [ropensci-books](https://github.com/ropensci-books) organizations.

## Another example: GitHub Pages

You can publish websites using a service called GitHub Pages.
By default, the website for a repository hosted at `github.com/account/repo` will be served at `account.github.io/repo`.
You can however use a _custom domain_.

- On the side of GitHub Pages, in the settings of your repository, you [declare](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) you want your website to be served at `custom.domain.io` for instance.

- On the side of your DNS provider, you create a record, for instance an A record for `custom.domain.io` that points to one of the IP addresses of GitHub Pages. A very general IP address not specific to your repository at all.

And... that's it! So, what prevents anyone from creating a repository on GitHub with malicious content and have its custom domain point to `custom.domain.io`?

Well, you can add another step to prevent such a takeover attack.
You can [verify your domain for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages)!

It works like the domain verification for GitHub profiles, with TXT records. 
It is controlled at the user or organization level, not at the repository level.
It is different from domain verification for profiles in that:

- It is done from another part of the settings. Follow the docs!
- If you have multiple subdomains, you will need to verify each one individually (e.g., `custom1.domain.io`, `custom2.domain.io`). You cannot verify a domain for more than one GitHub organization as the latest verification will overwrite the previous one![^ouch]

[^ouch]: Not only that, it will also deactivate all the custom domains of that first organization, if they relied on the verification at the domain, not the subdomain level. Ask me how I know. :melting_face:

## Conclusion

In this post, we gave a small primer on domain verification, a process by which you prove that your content on a given website comes from the same you on another website.
Using domain verification when it exists, and requesting it when it doesn't, makes us a bit safer against impersonations or takeover attacks.
