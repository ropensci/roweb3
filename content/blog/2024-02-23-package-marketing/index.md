Now that you have created your package, presenting it to the world is a crucial step to gain visibility and attract users.  In this blog post we suggest a series of activities and tools to let the people that your package can help, know that it is available. 

## Publish

Create a comprehensive README that clearly explains what your package does, how to install it, how users can start using it. Include examples or use cases and any relevant information (or links to) that can help users understand how your package can help them. 

[Create a universe on R-universe](/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/), which will help users by simplifying the installation of your package and provide with useful stats and information about it. R-Universe is also a way to showcase your packages collection. You can also [publish it on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) or submit it to our [peer review process](https://ropensci.org/software-review/). All this steps will support you with discoverability and also to comply with quality standards.  

## Promote 

Leverage platforms like Mastodon, LinkedIn, and R-specific forums such as [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com) and [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org) to announce the release of your package. 

> If you package is part of the rOpenSci Suite you can [write a blog post or a tech note](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/) for our blog and we will share in our [monthly newsletter](/news/) and our social media.

You can also share updates, tutorials, use cases, talks and events where you will participate to engage with users. 


> For rOpenSci packages, we collect the use cases and feature them on the website as well as the package. We also have social media campaing, for example "A Package a Day" on Mastodon were we feature one package of our suite each day. For LinkedIn we publish every Monday our "Package Weekly Digest" with a list of five package that belong to the same category.

If you like to give talks, you can speak at an R User Group or R-Ladies Chapter, organizers invite spekaers but most of the groups are open to people that offer to give a talk or teach a workshop. Present your package on a field specific conference is another way to reach your users and get greater exposure.  There are R specific conferences like useR!, LatinR, satRdays and Posit::Conf. 


> rOpenSci have two hours [co-working sessions each month](/coworking/), you can host a co-working session on the topic of the package.

> You can also propose an [rOpenSci Community Call](/commcalls/) relate with your package. For example, this community call about [targets](/commcalls/jan2023-targets/) has a panel with two users showing how they use the package and the principal author sharing new insights about the package.

You can check if you package fit in a [CRAN Task View]( https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) and propose the addition of your package.

> [rOpenSci's suite packages are featured in our webpage](https://ropensci.org/packages/) and we support the build the documentation in a website with pkgedown.
