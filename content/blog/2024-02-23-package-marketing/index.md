Now that you have created your package, presenting it to the world is a crucial step to gain visibility and attract users.  In this blog post we suggest a series of activities and tools to let the people that your package can help, know that it is available. 

## Publish

Create a comprehensive README that clearly explains what your package does, how to install it, how users can start using it. Include examples or use cases and any relevant information (or links to) that can help users understand how your package can help them. 

[Create a universe on R-universe](/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/), which will help users by simplifying the installation of your package and provide with useful stats and information about it. R-Universe is also a way to showcase your packages collection. You can also [publish it on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) or submit it to our [peer review process](https://ropensci.org/software-review/). All this steps will support you with discoverability and also to comply with quality standards.  

## Promote 

As a author or maintainer, here are some ideas you can implement:

* Social Media: leverage platforms like Mastodon, LinkedIn, and R-specific forums such as [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com) and [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org) to announce the release of your package. You can also share updates, tutorials, use cases, talks and events where you will participate to engage with users. 

> If you package is part of the rOpenSci Suite you can [write a blog post or a tech note](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/) for our blog and we will share in our [monthly newsletter](https://ropensci.org/news/).


For example, things maintainers can do:
host a co-working session on the topic of the package (with us).
Propose a comm call
Speak at a RUG or R-Ladies event, or a field specific conference.
Let know about their package in Rweekly (regarding this, I think we should say it's better to write a post as the list of new packages in R Weekly can be long


## rOpenSci support

We have our blog, and they can write about the package for our blog post.  Then we will share that on social media and our newsletter and our forum.

We have a package a day a package weekly digest on social media.

We collect the use cases and feature them on the website as well as the package.
