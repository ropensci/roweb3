rOpenSci suite of packages is mainly composed of packages contributed by the community through peer-review, and of packages maintained by staff. 
Over time, the commitments and availabilities of the original developers of a package change, which leads to some stepping down from their maintainer role, or hoping for more teamwork and therefore looking for co-maintainers.

## Why maintain or co-maintain a package?


## How to choose a package to (co-)maintain?

Although general technical skills will make you a good contributor to many packages, it is **crucial** to have specific interest in what a package does or the toolset it uses.
You might have that interest, because you use that package at work or because its scope falls under your topics of interest, for instance.
Being very interested in a package will make you more motivated, furthermore the user community will likely be a community of your peers.
