rOpenSci is a nonprofit organization that is funded entirely by grants and donations. These collaborations enable us to sustain our projects and meet our goals.

However, sustaining an open project with quality infrastructure freely accessible to the global and diverse community of R software users, research software developers, and engineers requires many different resources. Our organization's ongoing costs are supported by grants and donations from individuals and organizations which share our vision and mission.

These contributions enable us to keep our projects and infrastructure active and accessible to the community. Our projects are dedicated to establishing and upholding both technical and social infrastructure that supports open and reproducible science for all our members. This means our efforts must be sustainable, inclusive, and created collaboratively by and for all groups.

Each rOpenSci action seeks to break down barriers to access to knowledge one by one in the drive to democratize access to quality resources. Examples are the [R-Universe](/r-universe/), the [Champions Program](/champions/), or the [publication of multilingual](/multilingual-publishing/) resources. We also strive to transform science by creating processes and building capacity to ensure software quality and good practices, for example, our [statistical](/stat-software-review/) [software peer review](/software-review/). 

By supporting us, you’re not just donating; you’re contributing to a community that’s breaking down barriers, creating opportunities, and shaping the future of open and reproducible science for everyone. Join us in this vital mission today!

## Being part of the community

The concept of community gives meaning to the work of rOpenSci, and it is in this way that the projects are developed. Therefore, it is natural for us to look to the community to help us move forward.

Every little bit helps. That is why we invite you to collaborate with us or to share this information with all those people or organizations that may be interested.
