description: A look at treedata.table, a package for working efficiently with phylogenetic
  trees and data

The [data.table](http://r-datatable.com/) package enables high-performance extended functionality for data tables in R. [treedata.table](https://ropensci.github.io/treedata.table/) is a wrapper
for data.table for phylogenetic analyses that matches a phylogeny to the data.table, and preserves matching during data.table operations.
Using the data.table package greatly increases analysis reproducibility and the efficiency of data manipulation operations over other ways of performing similar tasks in
base R, enabling processing of larger trees and datasets.

### Why use treedata.table?

Simultaneous processing of phylogenetic trees and data remains a computationally-intensive task.
For example, processing a tree alongside a dataset of phylogenetic characters means processing much more data compared to processing the characters alone. This results in much longer processing times compared to more simple analysis with characters alone in data.table (Fig. 1A).
treedata.table provides new tools for increasing the speed and efficiency of phylogenetic data processing.
Data manipulation in treedata.table is significantly faster than in other commonly used packages such as base (>35%), treeplyr (>60%), and dplyr (>90%).
Additionally, treedata.table is >400% faster than treeplyr during the initial data/tree matching step (Fig. 1B).

### What can I do in treedata.table?

The simplest function that can be done in treedata.table is matching the tips of a phylogenetic tree to
the rows in a data.table object.
Like many R packages involving phylogenetic trees, treedata.table assumes that your tree is an object of class
phylo.
The first vignette (in English [here](https://ropensci.github.io/treedata.table/articles/AA_treedata.table_intro_english.html) and Spanish [here](https://ropensci.github.io/treedata.table/articles/AB_treedata.table_intro_spanish.html)) walks new users through matching a phylogeny to a data.table, and performing some common data operations, such as selecting data columns and dropping tips that do not have data.
There are other ways to achieve similar results, but as seen on Fig. 1, these are not as efficient.

Something unique in treedata.table is the ability to work with multiPhylo objects.
multiPhylo objects, as their name suggests, are colelctions of trees.
For example, perhaps you would like to match all the trees in a Bayesian posterior sample to a dataset to perform
a comparative methods analysis for every tree in your sample.
Our second [vignette](https://ropensci.github.io/treedata.table/articles/B_multiphylo_treedata.table.html) walks researchers through the process of syncing many trees to one dataset, manipulating the data, and performing a continuous trait evolution modeling exercise in [geiger](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geiger/index.html).   

Our other two vignettes cover important data functions researchers may wish to do with phylogenetic data.
For example, syncing names across datasets and phylogenetic trees based on [partial matching](https://ropensci.github.io/treedata.table/articles/C_PartialMatching.html), and [assorted data tidying functions](https://ropensci.github.io/treedata.table/articles/D_AdditionalFunctions_treedata.table.html).

### Where did treedata.table come from?

treedata.table is a research output from the [Nantucket DevelopR workshop](https://github.com/NantucketDevelopeR/2019Workshop).
Funded by an NSF grant to [Liam Revell](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/liam.revell/), the workshop aimed to support intermediate R developers working with phylogenetic and phylogenetic comparative methods.
Last time around, we had four instructors ([April Wright](https://paleantology.com), [Josef Uyeda](http://www.uyedalab.com/), [Claudia Solis-Lemus](https://solislemuslab.github.io/) and [Klaus Schliep](https://www.phangorn.org/)).
Each instructor taught one serious lesson during the week, and most did one "fireside chat" about being a computational scientist working in R.

But the real heart of the workshop was spending the day immersed in coding, both collaboratively and alone.
Participants each came with a project in mind, and made pitches to others for their project.
Some participants worked on multiple projects, or one with a group and one alone.
The instructors were housed separately, and often we'd show up to the beachside house to find everyone didn't want lecture yet - they were too busy working already.
Intermediate programmers are often sort of left to their own devices in education, and spending a week developing skills, community, and friendships was absolutely lovely. And, as evidenced by this package, productive!
