## Software :package:

### New packages




The following  package recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [qualR](https://docs.ropensci.org/qualR), developed by Mario Gavidia-Calderón together with Daniel Schuch: A package to download information from CETESB QUALAR <https://cetesb.sp.gov.br/ar/qualar/> and MonitorAr <https://www.rio.rj.gov.br/web/smac/monitorar-rio1> systems. It contains function to download different parameters, a set of criteria pollutants and the most frequent meteorological parameters used in air quality data analysis and air quality model evaluation. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/474) by Beatriz Milz, and Kaue de Sousa.

### Tech Notes

* [Searching and browsing the R universe](/blog/2022/03/23/runiverse-search) by Jeroen Ooms. We made a series of structural improvements in r-universe to make it easier to browse and discover interesting R packages and articles. Most notably, the landing page has been overhauled: you can now search directly for any name or keyword across the entire ecosystem.

* [rsnps 0.5.0: New ncbi_snp_query() Features](/blog/2022/03/29/rsnps-update) by Sina Rüeger, and Julia Gustavsen. `ncbi_snp_query()` now returns all reported variant allele frequencies in dbSNP.{{< figure src="plot-maf-1.png" alt="Allele frequencies in dbSNP for various studies/populations." width="400" >}}



* [Safeguards and Backups for GitHub Organizations](/blog/2022/03/22/safeguards-and-backups-for-github-organizations) by Maëlle Salmon. Some practical steps we've taken to safeguard our GitHub organizations.

## Use cases



One use case of our packages and resources has been reported since we sent the last newsletter.

* [Using vcr for HTTP testing of a package for Kobotoolbox](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-vcr-for-http-testing-of-a-package-for-kobotoolbox/2865). Reported by Frie.

Explore [other use cases](/usecases) and [report your own](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases/10)!

## Call for maintainers

There are no open calls for new maintainers at this point but you can refer to our [contributing guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) for finding ways to get involved!
As the maintainer of an rOpenSci package, feel free to contact us on Slack or email `info@ropensci.org` to get your call for maintainer featured in the next newsletter.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Identifying code duplication

Are you worried a codebase you've just inherited doesn't follow the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle?
You might find the [dupree package](https://russhyde.github.io/dupree/) by Russ Hyde useful: "The goal of dupree is to identify chunks / blocks of highly duplicated code within a set of R scripts.".

### Security for package developers

Did you know our development guide includes a short chapter on [Package Development Security Best Practices](https://devguide.ropensci.org/package-development-security-best-practices.html)?
Starting with the recommendation to enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](Package Development Security Best Practices) for your GitHub account.
We've also recently blogged on [Safeguards and Backups for GitHub Organizations](/blog/2022/03/22/safeguards-and-backups-for-github-organizations/)

### S3, S4, R6, R7 (not an April Fools' joke!)

Have you heard of the [R7 package](https://rconsortium.github.io/OOP-WG/)?
It is meant to be an object-oriented programming system successor to S3 and S4.
It is developped under the umbrella of an R Consortium working group, and a long term goal is to merge it into base R.
Explore the current repository and get a taste of the future!
