Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
Some housekeeping first:
We've been changing the infrastructure of our newsletter a bit so please update your RSS and JSON feeds to `https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/index.xml` and `https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/index.json`, respectively.
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/03/16/ropensci-news).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

Our R-universe project now has [its own page on our website](/r-universe/)! :rocket: The R-universe platform is a new umbrella project under which we experiment with various new ideas for improving publication and discovery of research software in R.

Regarding another exciting project of ours... We've run the first comm call of our series on the [statistical software review project](/stat-software-review/)! [rOpenSci Statistical Software Testing and Peer Review](/commcalls/feb2021-statsreview/) took place on March 2nd. The video recording (including closed captions) and resources as well as a summary have been [posted](/blog/2021/03/09/commcall-stats/).

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following two packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [pathviewr](https://docs.ropensci.org/pathviewr), developed by Vikram B. Baliga together with Melissa S. Armstrong, Eric R. Press: Tools to import, clean, and visualize movement data, particularly from motion capture systems such as Optitracks Motive, the Straw Labs Flydra, or from other sources. We provide functions to remove artifacts, standardize tunnel position and tunnel axes, select a region of interest, isolate specific trajectories, fill gaps in trajectory data, and calculate 3D and per-axis velocity. For experiments of visual guidance, we also provide functions that use subject position to estimate perception of visual stimuli. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/409) by Anne-Sophie Bonnet-Lebrun, Marco Sciaini.

+ [terrainr](https://docs.ropensci.org/terrainr), developed by Michael Mahoney: Functions for the retrieval, manipulation, and visualization of geospatial data, with an aim towards producing 3D landscape visualizations in the Unity 3D rendering engine. Functions are also provided for retrieving elevation data and base map tiles from the USGS National Map (<https://apps.nationalmap.gov/services/>).  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=terrainr). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/416) by Mike Johnson, Sydney Foks.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

Do you have some questions around **licensing of your R package**?
The [license chapter](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html) of the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan was [recently](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1307338435976364032) updated.
A less recent but interesting read is [Colin Fay's Licensing R e-book](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/index.html).

**Encoding** can also be a tricky topic for package developers.
Useful resources include [Kevin Ushey's blog post "String encoding and R"](http://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2018/02/21/string-encoding-and-r/), [Irene Steves' blog post "Encoding in R"](https://irene.rbind.io/post/encoding-in-r/), searching for encoding in ["Writing R Extensions"](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Encoding) (e.g. "_If the DESCRIPTION file is not entirely in ASCII it should contain an ‘Encoding’ field specifying an encoding. This is used as the encoding of the DESCRIPTION file itself and of the R and NAMESPACE files, and as the default encoding of .Rd files._"), some [threads of R-package-devel](https://www.mail-archive.com/r-package-devel@r-project.org/msg06536.html).

Afraid to forget something when you **submit your package to CRAN**?
A check list could help!
You can use [`usethis::use_release_issue()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_release_issue.html), [number one "secret" [of the tidyverse team] for avoiding multiple rounds of review with CRAN](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1359852335330164737).
Now, if you want to add your own specific bullet e.g. ["Update my brag document"](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) or ["Consider writing a tech note for rOpenSci blog"](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/index.html), you can add an [unexported `release_bullets()` function](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1183) returning a character vector to your package.

```r
release_bullets <- function() {
  c(
    "Update my brag document.",
    "Contact rOpenSci blog editors to schedule a tech note."
  )
}
```

For inspiration you can search the [CRAN mirror maintained by R-hub](https://github.com/search?q=release_bullets+user%3Acran&type=Code).
