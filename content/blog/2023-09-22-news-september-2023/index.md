Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2023/09/22/news-september-2023).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### WebAssembly support in R-universe!

Thanks to some help from George Stagg, we added experimental support for building WebAssembly binary packages. This makes it possible to install packages in [webr](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/), directly from r-universe.

### 123 Applications to our Champions Program 2023-2024

We are excited we received 123 applications from 41 countries on 5 continents!  
We are very grateful to everyone who submitted their proposals to our program.
The review process is starting. 
Stay tuned for updates!

### Coworking

Read [all about coworking](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/) in our recent [post](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)!

Join us for social coworking & office hours monthly on first Tuesdays! 
Hosted by Steffi LaZerte and various community hosts. 
Everyone welcome. 
No RSVP needed. 
Consult our [Events](/events) page to find your local time and how to join.

- ~~**Note** October coworking is cancelled (see you in November!)~~ **Nope, it's back on!** Stay tuned for coworking Tuesday, October 3rd, 14h00 Europe Central (12:00 UTC), Theme TBA

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!




### R Consortium Call for Proposals until October 1!

Do you have a project idea that is likely to have a broad impact on the R community and has a focused scope?
Don't miss the [twice-yearly R Consortium Call for Proposals](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals)!
Past funded projects include rOpenSci projects like the [HTTP testing in R book](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/awarded-projects/2020-group-1#http+testing+in+r+book), and work on the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/awarded-projects/2022-group-2#Tooling%20and%20Guidance%20for%20Translations%20of%20Markdown-Based%20R%20Content%20(Quarto,%20R%20Markdown">babeldown package</a>.




### Reminder: Our first community call in Spanish (and English too)

As global movements, Open Source and Open Science face language-based exclusion as most resources are in English. This affects scientists and research software engineers working in R, particularly those who don’t have English as their first language.

rOpenSci multilingual efforts aim to lower access barriers, democratize quality resources, and increase the possibilities of contributing to open software and science. We successfully piloted our Spanish-language peer review and the localization to Spanish of our comprehensive guide to software development, with Portuguese translation underway.

[Maëlle Salmon](/author/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/), [Paola Corrales](/author/paola-corrales/), and [Elio Campitelli](/author/elio-campitelli/),  will share the rOpenSci Multilingual project details on this call. Maëlle will present the R packages that allow us to have our content in several languages. Then Elio and Paola will share the translation workflow and show the Translation Guide written to document the process.

## Call for maintainers

If you're interested in maintaining any of the R packages below, you might enjoy reading our blog post [What Does It Mean to Maintain a Package?](/blog/2023/02/07/what-does-it-mean-to-maintain-a-package/) (or listening to its discussion on the [R Weekly highlights podcast](https://rweekly.fireside.fm/111) hosted by Eric Nantz and Mike Thomas)!

- **[rvertnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvertnet/index.html)**, Retrieve, map and summarize data from the VertNet.org archives (<https://vertnet.org/>). Functions allow searching by many parameters, including taxonomic names, places, and dates. In addition, there is an interface for conducting spatially delimited searches, and another for requesting large datasets via email. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/rvertnet/issues/71).

- **[natserv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/natserv/index.html)**. Interface to NatureServe (<https://www.natureserve.org/>). Includes methods to get data, image metadata, search taxonomic names, and make maps. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/natserv/issues/29).

### Call for comaintainers

Refer to our somewhat [recent blog post](/blog/2022/10/17/maintain-or-co-maintain-an-ropensci-package/#packages-looking-for-co-maintainers) to identify other packages where help is especially wished for!
See also our [help wanted page](/help-wanted/) -- before opening a PR, we recommend asking in the issue whether help is still needed.
