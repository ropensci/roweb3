## Maintaining Community Trust and Safety

The rOpenSci community is supported by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) 
with a clear description of unacceptable behaviors, 
instructions on how to make a report, 
and information on how reports are handled. 
We, the Code of Conduct Committee, 
are responsible for receiving, investigating, deciding, 
enforcing and reporting on all reports of potential violations of our Code. 
We are committed to transparency with our community while upholding the privacy 
of people who experience or report incidents.

**In 2025, we didn't received any Code of Conduct incident report.** 


## Community Feedback and Contact Information

The Code of Conduct Committee continues our commitment to maintaining a 
welcoming space where all members of the rOpenSci community can participate fully and confidently.
This code of conduct belongs to the community.
