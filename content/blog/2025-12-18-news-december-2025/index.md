<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup! <!-- blabla --> You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2025/12/18/news-december-2025). Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### rOpenSci at LatinR

We proudly continued supporting LatinR as a community partner in 2025. Here we share a list of resources and recordings for the [tutorials](/training/) and [talks](/talks/) delivered by our staff and community memebers at LatinR. Discover more on the [LatinR YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LatinR).

-   "R-universe Q&A" by Jeroen Ooms, Maëlle Salmon, [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWUwQM_5Hxo);
-   "Mejor código, sin esfuerzos, sin siquiera IA" by Maëlle Salmon, Hugo Gruson, Etienne Bacher, [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJT_omvdtZQ), [slides](https://masalmon.eu/talks/2025-12-04-latinr-mejor-codigo/);

### rOpenSci at uRos

Find Maëlle Salmon's slidedecks from the [uRos (Use of R in Official Statistics) 2025](https://r-project.ro/conference2025.html) conference:

-   tutorial ["Painlessly Improve Your Git History"](https://uros-git.netlify.app/#/);
-   keynote talk ["R packages, good vibes only"](https://maelle-uros.netlify.app/#/).

### Yani on the Give Me 5 Podcast

rOpenSci's community manager, Yani (Yanina Bellini Saibene), was recently interviewed on NumFOCUS's new podcast, Give Me 5. You can watch the [5-minute episode](https://youtu.be/SqafLv6CYPI?si=ck9SP5maloKiRl2L).

Yani's central message: people are the heart of open source. And when we invest in those people---maintainers, contributors, educators, and organizers---we strengthen the global scientific community.

### Coworking

Read [all about coworking](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)!

-   Tuesday January 13th, 9:00 Americas Pacific (17:00 UTC), ["Let it go!"](/events/coworking-2026-01/) with [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/) and cohost [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/).
    -   Spend some time reviewing the forums, Slack workspaces, Newsletters, RSS feeds (etc. etc.) you're subscribed to;
    -   Unsubscribe to all you no longer need (Let it go!);
    -   Meet co-host, Yanina Bellini Saibene, and discuss strategies for this New Year decluttering of your digital (or perhaps not-so-digital) life.
-   Tuesday February 2nd, 9:00 Australia Western (01:00 UTC), ["Share your Positron setup!"](/events/coworking-2026-02/) with [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/) and cohost [Noam Ross](/author/noam-ross/).
    -   Setup Positron and explore extensions and custom settings;
    -   Meet community host, Noam Ross, share how you have set up Positron for your workflow and learn from others.

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!

## Software :package:

### New packages





The following package recently became a part of our software suite:



-   [mantis](https://docs.ropensci.org/mantis), developed by T. Phuong Quan: Generate interactive html reports that enable quick visual review of multiple related time series stored in a data frame. For static datasets, this can help to identify any temporal artefacts that may affect the validity of subsequent analyses. For live data feeds, regularly scheduled reports can help to pro-actively identify data feed problems or unexpected trends that may require action. The reports are self-contained and shareable without a web server. It is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mantis). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/710) by Rodrigo Pires and Margaret Siple.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### An Advent Calendar about Package Development

[Athanasia Monika Mowinckel](https://drmowinckels.io/) has been curating an Advent Calendar about R Package Development! Follow her on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/drmowinckels.io/post/3m6tnwu2bfv27), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@Drmowinckels/115638077367401410), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmowinckels/).

### A new operator in base R: notin

Coming soon, a [new operator](https://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS/2025/12/05)!

> 'x %notin% table' newly in 'base' is an idiom for '!(x %in% table)' and provided almost entirely for convenience and code readability, from an R-devel suggestion, after many years of private definitions mostly hidden in packages, including in R's 'tools' package.

### New version of the jarl CLI

Etienne Bacher released a new version of jarl, the CLI for linting R code. See the [changelog](https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/changelog#section), including rules specific to testthat such as [`expect_length`](https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/rules/expect_length), to help you keep up with new testthat expectations.

### A safer `.gitignore` thanks to `usethis::git_vaccinate()`

The [`usethis::git_vaccinate()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/git_vaccinate.html) will vaccinate your global `.gitignore` file, making sure you for instance no longer commit those pesky `.DS_Store` files, or your `.Rhistory`. Tell your friends about it!
