Many people in our community actively contribute to rOpenSci projects. Many others would like to contribute but aren’t sure how to go about it.
Wanting to get involved in rOpenSci or wanting to give back to open source means different things to different people. 
Ideally, a person should be able to find something they could contribute that meets their needs and fits our mission. 
We created the [rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/)[^1] to make finding paths to contributing more transparent and sustainable.

Contributors come from a continuum of experience: from those who consider themselves newcomers exploring the landscape and trying to see where they fit, all the way to more experienced folks who know exactly what they have to offer and what they would like to contribute. We welcome code and non-code contributions from people at any career stage, and in any sector.

> . . . users pursuing their own “selfish” interests build collective value as an automatic byproduct. (Tim O’Reilly on The Architecture of Participation[^2])

Maybe you want to spend **30 minutes** sharing your package use case in our public forum or reporting a bug, **1 hour** learning by attending a Community Call, **5 hours** reviewing an R package submitted for open peer review, or maybe you want to make an **ongoing commitment** to help maintain a package. Our guide will walk you through the many avenues available, based on your motivations.


## Overview

The guide has three chapters.

1. [rOpenSci & Our Community](https://contributing.ropensci.org/intro.html) shares our mission, what it means to be part of our community, and introduces you to some Humans of rOpenSci. 

2. [What brings you here?](https://contributing.ropensci.org/motivations.html) is framed around different motivations. To help you recognize yourself, we categorized what we think contributors want into: [Discover](https://contributing.ropensci.org/motivations.html#discover); [Connect](https://contributing.ropensci.org/motivations.html#connect); [Learn](https://contributing.ropensci.org/motivations.html#learn); [Build](https://contributing.ropensci.org/motivations.html#build); [Help](https://contributing.ropensci.org/motivations.html#help). Each has a set of “I want to” statements. Clicking on any action under a statement takes you to Chapter 3 for a description of the relevant rOpenSci resource with details on how to contribute.

3. [rOpenSci Resources](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html) brings pointers to all of our resources together in one place. Each has a brief description and "How to contribute" with a set of specific actions that constitute specific contributions.

## A model for other communities?

We’re always standing on the shoulders of giants, some of whom might not think of themselves that way. 
The motivation, approach, design, tone, and content of this guide was influenced by many who are cited in our [bibliography](https://contributing.ropensci.org/bibliography.html).

In our dreams, the rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide can be a model for other open source communities to enable more transparent and sustainable participation.
