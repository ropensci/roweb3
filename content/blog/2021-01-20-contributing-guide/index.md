Many people in our community actively contribute to rOpenSci projects. Many others would like to contribute but aren’t sure how to go about it. 
Wanting to get involved in rOpenSci or wanting to give back to open source means different things to different people. 
Ideally, a person should be able to find something they could contribute that meets their needs and fits our mission. 
We created the [rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/)[^1] to make finding paths to contributing more transparent and sustainable.

rOpenSci fosters a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. 
We welcome code and non-code contributions from new and seasoned coders at any career stage, and in any sector. 
Our guide will walk you through the many avenues of contribution available to support open science. 
You don’t have to think of yourself as a developer to contribute! 

## Overview of the guide

First, we welcome you to rOpenSci, give examples of potential time commitments (starting with 30 minutes!) and some benefits of contributing. 
The body of the guide has three chapters.

1. [rOpenSci & Our Community](https://contributing.ropensci.org/intro.html) shares our mission, what it means to be part of our community, and introduces you to some Humans of rOpenSci. Participation in all rOpenSci activities is supported by our[ Code of Conduct](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#conduct).
2. Browse [What brings you here?](https://contributing.ropensci.org/motivations.html) to find your path to contributing! To help you recognize yourself, we grouped these into: Discover; Connect; Learn; Build; Help. For each category, we list examples of what those contributions might look like and we link to our resources to help you get started. 
3. [rOpenSci Resources](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html) brings pointers to all of our resources together in one place for the first time. Each has a description with links to guide specific contributions.


## A model for other communities?

In our dreams, the rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide can be a model for other open source communities to enable more transparent and sustainable participation.

We’re always standing on the shoulders of giants, some of whom might not think of themselves as giants. 
The motivation, approach, design, tone, and content of the rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide was influenced by many, who are cited in our [bibliography](https://contributing.ropensci.org/bibiliography.html).
