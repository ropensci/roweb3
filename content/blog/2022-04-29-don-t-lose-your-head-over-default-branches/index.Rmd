description: Use "HEAD" instead of the default branch name in links to files on GitHub, as it will work for any default branch name.

While the community standard for the default branch is now becoming main instead of master[^oppressive], and while the switch for any repo is rather [easy](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/easily-rename-your-git-default-branch-from-master-to-main) and is [well supported by usethis](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/), for a while (forever) there will still be repos with different default branches in the wild.[^roweb3] Especially as nothing prevents you from using any other name for the default branch (although this could trip up collaborators).

So, what to deal with the existence of different possible default branches?

- [usethis tooling regarding default branches](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/) including `usethis::git_default_branch()`, can be quite handy.
- You can also use gert directly, e.g. `gert::git_remote_ls()` will help show you remote references. The symref for ref contains the default branch name. 

```{r}
gert::git_remote_ls() |>
  head() # another useful thing named head
```

- When linking to a file, or trying to download the same path from a gaggle of repositories, think of the HEAD reference!
I.e. instead of linking to a file via `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<default-branch>/<path>` where you need to know what the default branch is, you can link to `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/HEAD/<path>` that will always point to the latest version of the path in the default branch. Similarly, for raw content, you can use links à la `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/HEAD/<path>`.

In conclusion, master or main? Hit the nail on the HEAD. :wink:

[^roweb3]: Actually, this post was the occasion to change the default branch for the source of this website!
