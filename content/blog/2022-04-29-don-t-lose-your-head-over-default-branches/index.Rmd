description: Use "HEAD" instead of the default branch name in links to files on GitHub, as it will work for any default branch name.

Read on for a little trick to always get the default branch...

While git has no "default" branch, online code platforms such as GitHub need to define a default for the branch that someone sees when they look at code online. While the community standard for the default branch is now becoming main instead of master[^oppressive], and while the switch for any repo is rather [easy](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/easily-rename-your-git-default-branch-from-master-to-main) and is [well supported by usethis](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/), for a while (forever) there will still be repos with different default branches in the wild.[^roweb3] Especially as nothing prevents you from using any other name for the default branch (although this could trip up collaborators).[^ghpages]

[^ghpages]: Some repos only have a branch called `gh-pages` (e.g. everything under https://github.com/ropensci-docs), in which case that is the default branch.

So, what to deal with the existence of different possible default branches?

- [usethis tooling regarding default branches](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/) including `usethis::git_default_branch()`, is very handy.
- You can also use gert directly, e.g. `gert::git_remote_ls()` will help show you remote references. The symref for ref contains the default branch name. 

```{r}
gert::git_remote_ls() |>
  head() # another useful thing named head
```

`gert::git_remote_info()`  shows the head for a given remote:

```{r}
gert::git_remote_info("origin")
```

- When linking to a file, or trying to download the same path from a gaggle of repositories, think of the HEAD reference!
I.e. instead of linking to a file via `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<default-branch>/<path>` where you need to know what the default branch is, you can link to `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/HEAD/<path>` that will always point to the latest version of the path in the default branch. Similarly, for raw content (to download), you can use links à la `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/raw/HEAD/<path>`.

In conclusion, master or main? Hit the nail on the HEAD. :wink:

[^roweb3]: Actually, this post was the occasion to change the default branch for the source of this website!
