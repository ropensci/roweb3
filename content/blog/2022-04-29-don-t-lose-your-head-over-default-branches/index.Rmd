While the community standard for the default branch is now becoming main instead of master[^oppressive], and while the switch for any repo is rather [easy](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/easily-rename-your-git-default-branch-from-master-to-main) and [well supported by usethis](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/), for a while there will still be repos with different default branches in the wild.[^roweb3]

So, what to deal with the existence of different possible default branches?

- [usethis tooling regarding default branches](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/) including `usethis::git_default_branch()`, can be quite handy.
- You can also use gert directly, e.g. `gert::git_remote_ls()` will help show you remote references.

```{r}
gert::git_remote_ls() |>
  head() # another useful thing named head
```

- When linking to a file, or trying to download the same path from a gaggle of repositories, think of the HEAD reference! I.e. instead of linking to a file via `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<default-branch>/<path>` where you need to know what the default branch is, you can link to `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/HEAD/<path>` that will always point to the latest version of the path in the default branch. Similarly, for raw content, you can use links à la `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/HEAD/<path>`.

In conclusion, master or main? Hit the nail on the HEAD. :wink:
