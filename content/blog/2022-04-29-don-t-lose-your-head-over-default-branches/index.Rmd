While the community standard for the default branch is now becoming main instead of master[^oppressive], and while the switch for any repo is rather [easy](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/easily-rename-your-git-default-branch-from-master-to-main) and well supported by usethis, for a while there will still be repos with different default branches in the wild.

[^oppressive]: For more context on Terminology, Power and Oppressive Language see for instance https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html
