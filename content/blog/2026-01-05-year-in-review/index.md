At the start of 2025, we outlined our goals for the year in the [2024 Highlights](/blog/2025/01/22/year-in-review-2024/). As the year started, our work took place in a far more challenging global context than many of us anticipated. Across countries, science and research faced funding cuts, layoffs, and attacks on diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion. These conditions reshaped timelines and capacities for institutions and for the people doing the work, but also reinforced why community-driven, open, and care-centered spaces matter.

This post looks back at what we said we would do and how that work played out in practice throughout 2025. We also share what our plans are for 2026. 

## Software peer review: steady growth and shared responsibility

Throughout 2025, software peer review remained a core activity at rOpenSci, completing 24 peer reviews. We have a continuous flow of new package submissions, approvals, and ongoing reviews, reflecting both the demand for high-quality research software and the commitment of our editors and reviewers.

New _20_ packages joined rOpenSci in domains like environmental and climate data, geospatial analysis, linguistics, and statistics. Existing packages receive more than _7000_ commits from _239_ unique users, _62_ of them contribute for the first time to rOpenSci!. Package maintainers released new versions, showing ongoing maintenance and responsiveness to users. 

Building on last year's commitments, we aimed to further improve the efficiency and usefulness of our software peer review system and explore its potential as a model for other communities.

We enhanced the review process by [improving dashboards](https://dashboard.ropensci.org), [updating guides](https://devguide.ropensci.org), and refining [pkgcheck](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/) and its GitHub Action, making participation easier for authors and reviewers. 

Leadership transitions within the program helped distribute responsibility and ensure continuity, while ongoing community participation demonstrated that peer review remains a collective effort.

## Strengthening shared infrastructure: R-Universe and Community Health 

In 2024, we committed to investing further in R-Universe as a shared, community-driven platform for publishing and distributing R packages, supported by long-term funding from the R Consortium.

In 2025, our investment in R-Universe produced clearer documentation, better tooling, and enhanced onboarding for users and contributors. A centralized documentation site provides unified guidance, making R-Universe more accessible and maintainable for individuals and communities.

_<TODO: Mention some of the other functionalities and improvements and also the work with R-multiverse and bioconductor>_

We made progress on developing a prototype dashboard that aims to help organizations maintain complex systems of interdependent software components. Our initial [prototype organizational dashboard](https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/repometrics-demo/) provides insights into code contributors, their repositories, and maintenance status and needs.

## Multilingual work as infrastructure, not an add-on

In 2024, we framed multilingualism as foundational to open science, not supplementary. We committed to expanding translations, improving workflows, and supporting communities working in languages other than English.

In 2025, following our 2024 commitment, we completed the [Portuguese translations of the rOpenSci Dev Guide](https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/11/25/translation-devguide-pt/) and progressed Spanish revisions of key content, blogs, program materials, and training. 

_<TODO: add links and some numbers>_

Beyond translation itself, we continued to treat multilingual publishing as infrastructure: refining AI-assisted workflows through the babeldown and babelquarto packages, enabling our website to support multilingual content, documenting processes, and sharing lessons so that other open science communities can adapt and reuse this work. 

We also have community calls, co-working sessions, and mini-hackathons in Spanish and Portuguese, offering our community content and program to Spanish- and Lusophone-speaking members.  Spanish-language events and resources reinforced rOpenSci’s commitment to multilingual participation and to meeting communities where they are.

In 2026, we will continue working on English and Spanish content generation and expand Portuguese content and processes, piloting a fully Portuguese software peer review and translating Champions Program Training material into Portuguese.  

We will continue our collaborations with other organizations and groups that translate and localize R content and offer not only content but also other aspects of our programs in languages other than English.

## The Champions Program with Latin American Flavor

One of our clearest goals for 2025 was to run the first fully Spanish-language cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program, with a focus on Latin America.

The 2025 cohort launched with an improved Spanish curriculum, Spanish-language community calls, outreach activities, and mentoring. To accomplish this, we translate all training materials and the infrastructure and artifacts necessary to run a successful cohort into Spanish. The program emphasized sustainable research software as a pillar of open science in the region, while strengthening peer networks among Champions, mentors, and alumni.

Alongside the new cohort, we also evaluated the second cohort to improve the program and better understand its impact. We conducted anonymous surveys and 1:1 interviews with champions and mentors and used their feedback to improve the program.

_<TODO: add some stats and quotes and links>_

In 2026, we will have a second cohort in Spanish and take steps toward longer-term sustainability for the program: testing new formats, strengthening partnerships, and beginning follow-up work with earlier cohorts to better understand the program's long-term impact.

## Community participation and pathways into open source

Throughout 2025, our blog, newsletters, and use case program continued to amplify community voices. These highlighted not only software releases but also the people, practices, and contexts behind them, reinforcing our focus on community participation.

During 2025, we published 49 posts on the rOpenSci blog. These included 41 blog posts and 8 technotes, with 18 posts authored or co-authored by community members, reflecting the continued openness of the blog to contributions beyond the staff team and the great participation of our community. Also, 60 authors contributed to the blog, 39 of them were authors writing for the first time for rOpenSci, an encouraging sign of ongoing renewal and engagement.

Our content was published in four languages during the reporting period: 13 posts were available in more than one language, and 16 posts were published in at least one non-English language, helping us reach a broader and more diverse audience.

We organized _3_ community calls and _13_ co-working sessions with _21_ unique presenters and more than _200_ attendees, with topics ranging from technical skills such as testing, version control, and package development to broader conversations about accessibility, contribution pathways, and getting to know other communities and organizations.

One of the goals for 2025 was to create more opportunities for people to engage with rOpenSci, especially first-time contributors.

In 2025, this took shape through mini-hackathons designed to lower barriers to participation. These events combined practical contribution opportunities with mentoring and social connection, reinforcing the idea that open source work is collaborative and learned through doing. [We wrote a guide to share our lessons learned organizing this type of event](https://ftc-guide.ropensci.org). Revisiting these formats throughout the year helped emphasize that open source participation is not a one-off event, but an ongoing practice that grows with continued support.


We also attend and support several other conferences and events _<TODO: add some links and stats of talks/tutorials/keynotes>_

In 2026, we plan to continue organizing community calls in multiple human languages, co-working sessions, and mini-hackathons. If you want to collaborate in any of these spaces, please get in touch with us.  We also hope to see you in some of the R, open science, and open source conferences around the world.

## What we learned 

Looking back, in 2025, we focused on being true to our core community values and delivering on commitments made the year before. Where plans evolved, they did so in response to capacity, collaboration, and community feedback.

Closing the loop between intention and action is an accountability and a learning practice. It helps us see which investments compound over time, which structures enable others to lead, and where care and sustainability matter most.

As we look ahead, we do so grounded in what 2025 demonstrated: that open science is built through steady, collective work, with Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility at the center, and that sharing what we plan to do matters most when we return to show what we actually did, while staying true to the principles that hold this community together.
