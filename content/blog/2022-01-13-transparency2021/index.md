description: No Code of Conduct incidents reported in 2021

The rOpenSci community is supported by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) with a clear description of unacceptable behaviors, instructions on how to make a report, and information on how reports are handled. We, the Code of Conduct Committee, are responsible for receiving, investigating, deciding, enforcing and reporting on all reports of potential violations of our Code. We are committed to transparency with our community while upholding the privacy of people who experience or report incidents.

In 2021, we did not receive any Code of Conduct incident reports.

We acknowledge that a lack of incident reports does not mean everyone feels comfortable participating. If in doubt, please contact us at conduct at ropensci.org.
