As of this week, we are closing our forum at `discuss.ropensci.org`.
The forum has become largely inactive in recent years, so we are consolidating our conversations to our other online spaces to reduce maintenance and moderation burden.

We're not putting our community building aside or behind a wall! We remain committed to our [values](/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/) and to maintaining an open community. 
We've migrated the most active part of the forum, the use cases collection, to our [website](/usecases), and we will continue to collect them via [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/discussions/categories/use-cases).
Don't forget that there are still many other ways to be part of the [rOpenSci Community](https://contributing.ropensci.org/):

- Your contributions to our [R packages](/help-wanted), [infrastructure](/r-universe), projects such as the [Champions Program](/champions) and [software-review](/software-review), are always welcome!
- You can meet with us at [events](/events) including [coworking](/coworking) and [community calls](/commcalls).
- You can also reach us at <info@ropensci.org> and tohear from us, subscribe to our RSS feed or our [newsletter](/news)!
- Check out our [contributing guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org) for more ideas!

We look forward to a continuing collaboration with our evergrowing community.
