As of this week, our `discuss.ropensci.org` forum is no more.
We remain committed to our [values](/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/), and have been doing [good work](/blog/2026/01/22/yearinreview2025/).
However, we can't overstretch our time and funding, therefore we have to be realistic and intentional about the platforms and services we provide.
That's why we decided to close our Discourse forum:
while it used to be active, it was becoming extremely quiet, without our having the resources to revive it,
and while we still needed to review potential spam and pay for our subscription.

Now, this does not mean we're putting our community building aside or behind a wall!
Your contributions to our [R packages](/help-wanted), [infrastructure](/r-universe), [use cases](/use-cases), projects such as the [champions program](/champions) and [software-review](/software-review), are still welcome!
You can also reach us at `info@ropensci.org` and check out our [contributing guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org).
And to hear from us, subscribe to our RSS feed or our [newsletter](/news)!

We look forward to a continuing collaboration with our evergrowing community.
