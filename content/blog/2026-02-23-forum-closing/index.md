As of this week, we are closing our forum at `discuss.ropensci.org`.
The forum has become largely inactive in recent years, so we are consolidating our conversations to our other online spaces to reduce maintenance and moderation burden.

We're putting our community building aside or behind a wall! We remain committed to our [values](/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/) of of open community. 
We've migrated the most active part of the forum, the [use cases](/use-cases) collection, to our website, and we will continue to collect them via [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/discussions/categories/use-cases)
Your contributions to our [R packages](/help-wanted), [infrastructure](/r-universe), projects such as the [champions program](/champions) and [software-review](/software-review), are still welcome!
You can meet with us at [events](/events) including [coworking](/coworking) and [community calls](/commcalls).
You can also reach us at `info@ropensci.org` and check out our [contributing guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org).
And to hear from us, subscribe to our RSS feed or our [newsletter](/news)!

We look forward to a continuing collaboration with our evergrowing community.
