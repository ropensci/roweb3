<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup! <!-- blabla --> You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2025/05/26/news-may-2025). Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Help us maintain {pkgcheck}!

You might know of [our {pkgcheck} system](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/) used for our automated package checks, and for your own stand-alone and [GitHub-action usage](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action) on any package. We are seeking co-maintainers for the {pkgcheck} package that powers that. In particular, we have several [ideas for additional checks in current repo issues](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%3Amag%3A%20Check%20Idea%22). We would like volunteers to attend an online get-together for us to coach you on how to implement new checks, and so to help you get involved in maintaining and further developing our checking system. If you're interested and already part of our slack group, please join our dedicated `#pkgcheck` channel, otherwise email `mark@ropensci.org`.

### Coworking

Read [all about coworking](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)!

-   Tuesday Jun 3, 2025 2:00 PM CEST (12:00 UTC), ["Getting to know the DSLC"](/events/coworking-2025-06/) with [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/) and cohost [Jon Harmon](/author/jon-harmon/).
    -   Visit the [DSLC](https://dslc.io/).

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!

## Software :package:

### New packages

<div class="highlight">

</div>

The following package recently became a part of our software suite:

<div class='highlight'>

-   [forcis](https://docs.ropensci.org/forcis), developed by Nicolas Casajus together with Mattia Greco, Sonia Chaabane, Xavier Giraud, and Thibault de Garidel-Thoron: Provides an interface to the FORCIS database (<doi:10.5281/zenodo.7390791>) on global foraminifera distribution. This package allows to download and to handle FORCIS data. It is part of the FRB-CESAB working group FORCIS. <https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/forcis/>. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/660) by Air Forbes and Scott Chamberlain.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### Roaringly Acknowledge Organizations with ROR IDs in DESCRIPTION

In our [recent blog post](/blog/2025/05/09/ror/) we explained what ROR IDs are: they are to organizations what ORCID are for individuals. They help acknowledge more precisely an organization (a company that owns the copyright, a non-profit that funded the work, etc.) in package's metadata. [Read more](/blog/2025/05/09/ror/).

### Safeguard your documentation in check environments

Or, in other words, how to have your package *not* fail `R CMD check` on CRAN, but examples and vignettes still rendered in pkgdown documentation?

Thanks to Alasdair Warwick, maintainer of the recently reviewed [gtexr package](https://docs.ropensci.org/gtexr/), for summarizing [some advice](https://github.com/ropensci-org/rotemplate/issues/120#issuecomment-2831521763) that we copy below:

-   For function examples, use the [`examplesIf` roxygen2 tag](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html?q=examplesIf#examples) with the `IN_PKGDOWN` variable e.g. `#' @examplesIf identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")`
-   For vignettes, either pre-build if special tools/data/credentials are required which are unavailable on generic build servers (see <https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/12/08/precompute-vignettes/>), or use the `IN_PKGDOWN` variable with knitr eval option e.g.

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval = Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN") == "true"
)
```

Examples:

-   `examplesIf`: <https://github.com/ropensci/gtexr/blob/592ac781672f07eb67e935d4155570c5960d1fdb/R/get_service_info.R#L14> (see also Docs of the roxygen2 tag: <https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html?q=examplesIf#examples>)
-   Vignette, knitr eval option: <https://github.com/ropensci/gtexr/blob/592ac781672f07eb67e935d4155570c5960d1fdb/vignettes/gtexr.Rmd#L16>

### More on {renv} and R versions

To follow up on last newsletter's item ["🔗 CI: Pin the R version if using renv"](/blog/2025/04/28/news-april-2025/#ci-pin-the-r-version-if-using-renv), a tip by Hugo Gruson: it's also possible to automatically set the R version to the one documented in `renv.lock` when using the [`r-lib/setup-r`action](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/4f58f8ffa872cbd4cb016c51ec497fdbe0a02711/setup-r/README.md?plain=1#L37).

### `usethis::use_air()`

In March we mentioned [Air](/blog/2025/03/27/news-march-2025/#air-a-new-formatter-for-r), the new formatter developed at Posit. In usethis development version, there's a function that helps you set up a project to use Air: [`use_air()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/dev/reference/use_air.html). See also the [issue about the JSON config](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/2114).

### Better HTTP testing with vcr's development version

Breaking news: a new vcr version is in the works! Follow the activity by Hadley Wickham and Scott Chamberlain in vcr's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropensci/vcr), check out the new [`local_cassette()` function](https://docs.ropensci.org/vcr/reference/use_cassette.html)... Or just wait for the next release! :smile_cat:
