<!-- Before sending DELETE THE INDEX_CACHE and re-knit! -->

Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2023/06/22/ropensci-news-digest-june-2023).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Meeting the stars of the R-universe: PEcAn, an Open Source Project to Take Care of the Planet

Knowing our community's stories helps us to learn about the people behind our software, brings us closer and offers us new opportunities. To share some of these community stories, we created the rOpenSci interview series [_"Meeting the stars of the R-Universe"_](/tags/r-universe-stars/).

Climate change and research in this area have diverse and complex data that demand increasingly complex analysis models. The PEcAn project works to develop this ability.

In this [interview](/blog/2023/06/06/r-universe-stars-4-en/), we go into the science of climate change, and explore where data analysis and ecosystem modeling tools are developed. That is the main objective of the PEcAn project, where they collaboratively seek new ways to collect and synthesize data and develop accessible tools to perform these tasks in a reproducible way.
Our discussion was attended by Rob Kooper, Chris Black, Eric Scott, Michael C. Dietze, and David LeBauer. All members of the PEcAn project with the same goal: to find more and better ways to integrate the enormous amount of existing data on climate change.

You can also read the post in [Spanish](/es/blog/2023/06/06/r-universe-stars-4-es/).

### Downloading snapshots and creating stable R packages repositories using R-universe!

The [new snapshot API](/blog/2023/05/31/runiverse-snapshots/) lets you download a full copy of any CRAN-like repository on R-universe. You can use such a snapshot to mirror the entire CRAN-like repository on your own servers, or for example to build a stable, validated release of your package suite.

### Statistical software review now completely integrated with standard review process

[Statistical software review](/software-review/) has finally reached a stable and mature state, with all organizational processes now entirely integrated with the standard review process.
Developers submitting software should notice little difference, except hopefully faster initial processing of submissions.
Each submission is now smoothly handled by members of our [team](/software-review/#editors) of statistical software editors:

-   [Adam Sparks](/author/adam-sparks/)
-   [Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.org/)
-   [Jouni Helske](/author/jouni-helske/)
-   [Paula Moraga](https://www.paulamoraga.com/)
-   [Rebecca Killick](/author/rebecca-killick/)
-   [Toby Hocking](https://tdhock.github.io/)

We currently accept software in the eight categories described in our [*Statistical Software Development Guide*](https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org/standards.html), and are still working on integrating the two additional categories of Statistical Workflow and Network Software.
We encourage anybody thinking about submitting to contact any one of the editors, or the two leaders of the software review team, [Noam Ross](/author/noam-ross/) and [Mark Padgham](/author/mark-padgham/), at any time, including anybody interested in submitting software in the upcoming categories of workflow or network software.

### rOpenSci's Communication Channels for Safe and Friendly Exchange

As [we anticipated in November 2022](/blog/2022/11/16/mastodon-en) the changes implemented by Twitter have generated a less safe and friendly space for our community.
That is why from _June 2023_, we will stop interacting on this platform. 
We will maintain the account in hopes that we can return when Twitter is once again a safe and supportive space, but in the meanwhile will focus our communication efforts elsewhere.
Read more in our [announcement](/blog/2023/06/14/ropensci-communication-channels-en/).

### Two upcoming community calls!

#### A Journey through Arrow in R

Wednesday, 28 June 2023 16:00 UTC. [More info](/commcalls/jun2023-arrow/).

Apache Arrow is a software development platform for building high performance applications that process and transport large data sets. It is designed to improve the performance of data analysis methods, and to increase the efficiency of moving data from one system or programming language to another.

In this [community call](/commcalls/jun2023-arrow/) moderated by Stephanie Hazlitt, our speakers, Nic Crane and Jonathan Keane, will lead us through the Arrow R package.

#### Mentoring & training program for Scientific Open Source Champions

Tuesday, 25 July 2023 14:00 UTC. [More info](/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/).

Champions programs are designed to identify, recognize, and reward emerging leaders within a community. The [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities, which means that it needs to be sustainable and open, and built by and for all groups.

On this [call](/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/) _Beatriz Milz_, _Victor Ordu_ and _Carolina Pradier_ will share their experience of being rOpenSci mentors and champions. 
We will highlight the benefits of being part of the program for you and for your community, what kind of learning, 
activities and opportunities an open source community champions program provides. 
_Yani_ will present the details of our Champion Program and answer all your question about it.

### Coworking

## Call for maintainers

### Call for maintainers

If you're interested in maintaining any of the R packages below, you might enjoy reading our blog post [What Does It Mean to Maintain a Package?](/blog/2023/02/07/what-does-it-mean-to-maintain-a-package/) (or listening to its discussion on the [R Weekly highlights podcast](https://rweekly.fireside.fm/111) hosted by Eric Nantz and Mike Thomas)!

- **[rvertnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvertnet/index.html)**, Retrieve, map and summarize data from the VertNet.org archives (<https://vertnet.org/>). Functions allow searching by many parameters, including taxonomic names, places, and dates. In addition, there is an interface for conducting spatially delimited searches, and another for requesting large datasets via email. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/rvertnet/issues/71).

- **[natserv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/natserv/index.html)**. Interface to NatureServe (<https://www.natureserve.org/>). Includes methods to get data, image metadata, search taxonomic names, and make maps. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/natserv/issues/29).

- **[geojsonlint](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geojsonlint/index.html)**, Tools for linting GeoJSON. Includes tools for interacting with the online tool <https://geojsonlint.com>, the Javascript library geojsonhint (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/geojsonhint>), and validating against a GeoJSON schema via the Javascript library (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-my-json-valid>). Some tools work locally while others require an internet connection. [Issue for volunteering](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/geojsonlint/issues/22).

### Call for comaintainers

Refer to our somewhat [recent blog post](/blog/2022/10/17/maintain-or-co-maintain-an-ropensci-package/#packages-looking-for-co-maintainers) to identify other packages where help is especially wished for!
See also our [help wanted page](/help-wanted/) -- before opening a PR, we recommend asking in the issue whether help is still needed.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### How to produce code hints for users?

Sometimes your code can infer what the next user step should be, or what the next _possible_ user _steps_ could be.
How to make it easy for the user to run these hints?

Here's some inspiration:

* You could use [`cli::ui_todo()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/ui.html), as done in usethis. By the way if your package is using `ui_` functions from usethis, don't miss the cli article on how to [migrate your code to using cli instead](https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/usethis-ui.html), as that's what's currently recommended. 

* Also in the cli package, a you can provide a special kind of link that runs the code if clicked in the RStudio IDE: ["Click to run code"](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/links.html?q=run#click-to-run-code). You might recognize this from running snapshot tests with testthat, and receiving the message to review/accept them with these special links.

```r
cli::cli_text("Run {.run praise::praise()} now!")
```

* If your code is run in RStudio IDE (checkable with [`rstudioapi::isAvailable()`](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioapi/reference/isAvailable.html)), you could use [`rstudioapi::sendToConsole()`](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioapi/reference/sendToConsole.html) to send example code to the console for the user to consider ([example](https://github.com/cynkra/fledge/blob/520b9b2e36da7bc58136378407f1f4454bfbeadf/R/finalize-version.R#L63-L80=)).

### devtag: Restrict Some Help Files to Development 

The new [devtag package by Antoine Fabri](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/devtag) "allows you to use `@dev` tags in your roxygen2 headers so you’ll generate help files for unexported objects, that you will enjoy during development but won’t be accessible for users that install your package".
This might be nicer to read than the classical [`@NoRd` docs for internal functions](https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/12/12/internal-functions/#how-to-document-internal-functions)!

### Useful post on the retirement of popular spatial packages

Don't miss Jakub Nowosad' blog post ["Upcoming changes to popular R packages for spatial data: what you need to do"](https://geocompx.org/post/2023/rgdal-retirement/)!
And again, tell your spatial R friends about this big change.

### More on CRAN C++ requirements

Do you remember the tidyverse article ["New CRAN requirements for packages with C and C++"](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/03/cran-checks-compiled-code/)?
You might also enjoy this [repo](https://github.com/mpadge/settest) by rOpenSci Mark Padgham, "Test R package compilation with >= C++17".
