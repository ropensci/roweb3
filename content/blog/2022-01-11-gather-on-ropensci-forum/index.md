Do you have an account on [rOpenSci forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org)?
As underlined in our [contributing guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels) our forum is where we encourage Q&A and exploraton of ideas on a various range of topics.
We have recently streamlined categories so that it might be easier for you to find where to post, and what to follow.
In this post we shall present current forum categories, and ways for you to keep up-to-date with the activity without getting overwhelmed.

## Forum categories

First note that forum categories are there to serve users, not the other way round!
So if you post in the "wrong" category, no problem! 
We can transfer the post to a more relevant category if relevant to get more eyes on it, but really no harm done!

### Package Use Questions

Wonder how to [combine images with magick](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/magick-combining-several-images-into-one-while-controlling-their-relative-position/2697/3)?
Or how to [update resources with ckanr](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/updating-resources-with-ckanr/2631/6)?
[Package Use Questions](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/packages/7) is the category for Q&A on any of our [packages](/packages).

### Package Development

This is the category you'd end up in via the blog itself, as it's used for commenting!
