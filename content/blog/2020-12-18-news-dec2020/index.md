* Peter Desmet asked a question that many R package maintainers run in to: [What if raw data in package is too large?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/what-if-raw-data-in-package-is-too-large/1955)


## In the News

* One of our software review editors, [Anna Krystalli](https://twitter.com/annakrystalli), was featured in the podcast RSE Stories, in an episode titled [R for Reproducibility](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/anna-krystalli/)

## Call For Maintainers

Part of our mission is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Sometimes software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).
