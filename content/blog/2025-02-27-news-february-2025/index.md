Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2025/02/27/news-february-2025).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Open Science and Open Source only with Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility

Including all of humanity is and always will be at the heart of open science.
Read more about our mission in our [blog post](/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/).

### "This is Tech Talks" episode with Yanina Bellini Saibene

Yanina Bellini Saibene was interviewed by Santosh Yadav about her role as rOpenSci community manager.

### "From Novice to Contributor" on the R Weekly Highlights podcast

Our community call ["From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS"](/commcalls/first-time-contributor/) with Yi-Chin Sunny Tseng, Pascal Burkhard, Yaoxiang Li, Hugo Gruson was featured in the [R Weekly Highlights podcast](https://serve.podhome.fm/episodepage/r-weekly-highlights/193) hosted by Eric Nantz and Mike Thomas.

### Coworking Mini-hackathons

Read [all about coworking](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)!

Join us for our second [Coworking Mini-Hackatho for First-Time Contributors](/events/coworking-2025-03/). 
If you’re curious about contributing to Open Source Software, and would like some support to get started, this event are for you!

During this session you’ll join others making contributions to R packages while [package maintainers and other mentors](/blog/2024/10/22/first-time-contributions/) are available ’live’ to answer questions and give guidance.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### How to deal with testthat snapshots with variable output

[Snapshot test](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/snapshotting.html) are a great way to ensure messages and complicated output aren't broken.
Now, some randomness might lead to snapshot test failure: for instance, if your function's message displays a Git commit hash that changes every time.

How to handle this?
Two possibilities...

- You can use the `transform` argument of `testthat::expect_snapshot()`, that accepts a function transforming a character input into a character output. For instance, an unit test of `ggplot2::ggsave()` creates PNG files in a temporary directory. That temporary directory changes at every run. Therefore, the [call to `expect_snapshot()`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/d835cfe2ffb0ff68c9a4b224ec1fcb4caba83892/tests/testthat/test-ggsave.R#L85) is:

```r
expect_snapshot(
  x <- suppressMessages(ggsave(c(file1, file2), plot)),
  transform = function(x) gsub(" \\'.*\\.png\\'", "'PATH'", x)
)
```

That handy `transform` argument of `expect_snapshot()` might get even better over time, as an open issue suggests [providing a set of default transformers for snapshot tests](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/1822).

- Another solution is to make the random part of your function's messages and output fixed based on an environment variable that you [set in tests](https://withr.r-lib.org/reference/with_envvar.html) (or using [mocking](https://blog.r-hub.io/2024/03/21/mocking-new-take/)).

### How to load packages in testthat tests

Another testthat topic, thanks to software review editor [Margaret Siple](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA).
How to load packages used in tests?

- There is no need to load the package under development, testthat will do it for you. This includes loading internal functions. This means that the test files of package *mypackage* should *not* start with `library(mypackage)`.
- There's rarely a need for using `library()` calls in test files or helper files. Indeed, testthat will load your own package, and any package or function imported in your package. Now, for packages listed in for instance `Suggests` and used only in tests, you should use [`pkg::function_name()`](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#sec-testing-design-tension). This makes it possible for R to find the function, but also for easier [debugging of a failed test](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#plan-for-test-failure). An example _exception_ is the [loading of httptest2](https://enpiar.com/httptest2/reference/use_httptest2.html) in a helper file.

### Don't get bitten by GitHub Protected Branches

GitHub's branch protection rules can prevent pushing directly to protected branches. 
It is, however, still possible to locally commit to a protected branch, but an attempt to push to GitHub will be rejected. 
You then have a commit tree that can't be pushed, and that must somehow be reverted. 
An easy way to prevent this is to use Lorenz Walthert's [precommit R package](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/) with a local hook like this:

``` r
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

if (identical (gert::git_branch (), "main")) # or whatever protected branch is called
    stop ("main branch is protected on GitHub; commits must be made via PR from other branch")
```
Local hooks can be called from your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file like in [this example](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgmatch/blob/47e0775e6bdc3f96f146f4fd959affe50c9dd4bf/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L79-L82), which has the hook defined above in a `.hook/` sub-directory. 
That precommit hook will then prevent you from local commits to any branch that is protected on GitHub.

### What is laziness in R

If you're confused about the meaning of "lazy" in R programming, you might benefit from this blog post by Maëlle Salmon, Athanasia Mo Mowinckel and Hannah Frick on the R-hub blog: [Lazy introduction to laziness in R](https://blog.r-hub.io/2025/02/13/lazy-meanings/).

### Find missing .Rd tags with {checkhelper}

The [checkhelper package](https://thinkr-open.r-universe.dev/checkhelper) by [Sébastien Rochette](/author/sébastien-rochette/) helps you identify missing documentation pieces before a submission to CRAN: for instance, missing `@return`.
There might be false positives, for instance if you document several functions on a single page with the same `@return` ([issue](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/checkhelper/issues/84)) but it's nonetheless a handy tool when preparing a CRAN submission.
