Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
<!-- blabla -->
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2025/02/27/news-february-2025).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

### Open Science and Open Source only with Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility

Including all of humanity is and always will be at the heart of open science.
Read more about our mission in our [blog post](/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/).

### Mark Padgham is now Software Review Lead

[Mark Padgham](/author/mark-padgham) is now lead for software peer review. Noam Ross, the former lead, became Executive Director [last year](/blog/2024/03/29/hello-from-our-new-executive-director/).

### New rOpenSci Champion(a|e)s Program cohort

We have great news!  We will have a new cohort of our [Champion(a|e) Program](/champions/) during 2025! 

Our program seeks to identify, recognize, and reward individuals who are leaders in an open science community, research software engineering, and the R programming community.

This year's program, thanks to [funding by CZI](/blog/2024/10/10/czi-latam-grant/), is focused on people from Latin America and will be conducted entirely in Spanish. 

This program is an incredible platform for developing your open-source project with expert support, interacting, sharing, and strengthening a network with other people determined to develop open and reproducible science in your part of the world.
Stay tuned for our announcement of the opening call to apply as a champion or mentor and join a global community of people using and developing scientific and open-source software.

### "This is Tech Talks" episode with Yanina Bellini Saibene


Yanina Bellini Saibene was interviewed by Santosh Yadav about her role as rOpenSci community manager.
Watch the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PsbCPtxWXk).

### "From Novice to Contributor" on the R Weekly Highlights podcast

Our community call ["From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS"](/commcalls/first-time-contributor/) with Yi-Chin Sunny Tseng, Pascal Burkhard, Yaoxiang Li, Hugo Gruson was featured in the [R Weekly Highlights podcast](https://serve.podhome.fm/episodepage/r-weekly-highlights/193) hosted by Eric Nantz and Mike Thomas.

### Coworking Mini-hackathons

Read [all about coworking](/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/)!

Join us for our second [Coworking Mini-Hackatho for First-Time Contributors](/events/coworking-2025-03/). 
If you’re curious about contributing to Open Source Software, and would like some support to get started, this event is for you!

During this session you’ll join others making contributions to R packages while [package maintainers and other mentors](/blog/2024/10/22/first-time-contributions/) are available ’live’ to answer questions and give guidance.

- [Tuesday March 4th 14:00 European Central (13:00 UTC)](/events/coworking-2025-03)
After this we return to our regular monthly social coworking & office hours held on first Tuesdays! Hosted by Steffi LaZerte and various community hosts. Everyone welcome. No RSVP needed. Consult our [Events](/events/) page to find your local time and how to join.

- [Tuesday April 1st 9:00 Americas Pacific (16:00 UTC)](/events/coworking-2025-04), "R you joking? Silly R packages for April Fools' day" with [Steffi LaZerte](/author/steffi-lazerte/) and [Yanina Bellini Saibene](/author/yanina-bellini-saibene/)
    - Explore silly R packages
    - Chat with our hosts and other attendees and share your favourite silly R packages!

And remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!

### New pkgcheck checks

Our [pkgcheck](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/) package is used both for our [software review](/software-review/) submission checks, and in [pkgcheck-action](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action).
It now features two additional checks:

- A check that packages do not [list excessive numbers of package _Imports_](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/articles/list-checks.html#pkgchk_num_imports).
  Packages with numbers of imports exceeding the 95% of current CRAN packages (which is currently 21 imported packages) will receive an :eyes: note.
- A check that repositories do not [name the default GitHub branch "master"](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/articles/list-checks.html#pkgchk_branch_is_master), and will fail if so.
  See [this tidyverse blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/) for helpful advice on renaming default branches.

The [pkgcheck-action](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action) has also been updated to run on Ubuntu 24.04, and to include quarto to enable packages to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as a vignette engine.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### How to deal with testthat snapshots with variable output

[Snapshot test](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/snapshotting.html) are a great way to ensure messages and complicated output aren't broken.
Now, some randomness might lead to snapshot test failure: for instance, if your function's message displays a Git commit hash that changes every time.

How to handle this?
Two possibilities...

- You can use the `transform` argument of `testthat::expect_snapshot()`, that accepts a function transforming a character input into a character output. For instance, an unit test of `ggplot2::ggsave()` creates PNG files in a temporary directory. That temporary directory changes at every run. Therefore, the [call to `expect_snapshot()`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/d835cfe2ffb0ff68c9a4b224ec1fcb4caba83892/tests/testthat/test-ggsave.R#L85) is:

```r
expect_snapshot(
  x <- suppressMessages(ggsave(c(file1, file2), plot)),
  transform = function(x) gsub(" \\'.*\\.png\\'", "'PATH'", x)
)
```

That handy `transform` argument of `expect_snapshot()` might get even better over time, as an open issue suggests [providing a set of default transformers for snapshot tests](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/1822).

- Another solution is to make the random part of your function's messages and output fixed based on an environment variable that you [set in tests](https://withr.r-lib.org/reference/with_envvar.html) (or using [mocking](https://blog.r-hub.io/2024/03/21/mocking-new-take/)).

### How to load packages in testthat tests

Another testthat topic, thanks to software review editor [Margaret Siple](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA).
How to load packages used in tests?

- There is no need to load the package under development, testthat will do it for you. This includes loading internal functions. This means that the test files of package *mypackage* should *not* start with `library(mypackage)`.
- There's rarely a need for using `library()` calls in test files or helper files. Indeed, testthat will load your own package, and any package or function imported in your package. Now, for packages listed in for instance `Suggests` and used only in tests, you should use [`pkg::function_name()`](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#sec-testing-design-tension). This makes it possible for R to find the function, but also for easier [debugging of a failed test](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#plan-for-test-failure). An example _exception_ is the [loading of httptest2](https://enpiar.com/httptest2/reference/use_httptest2.html) in a helper file.

### Don't get bitten by GitHub Protected Branches

GitHub's branch protection rules can prevent pushing directly to protected branches. 
It is, however, still possible to locally commit to a protected branch, but an attempt to push to GitHub will be rejected. 
You then have a commit tree that can't be pushed, and that must somehow be reverted. 
An easy way to prevent this is to use Lorenz Walthert's [precommit R package](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/) with a local hook like this:

``` r
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

if (identical (gert::git_branch (), "main")) # or whatever protected branch is called
    stop ("main branch is protected on GitHub; commits must be made via PR from other branch")
```
Local hooks can be called from your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file like in [this example](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgmatch/blob/47e0775e6bdc3f96f146f4fd959affe50c9dd4bf/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L79-L82), which has the hook defined above in a `.hook/` sub-directory. 
That precommit hook will then prevent you from local commits to any branch that is protected on GitHub.

### What is laziness in R

If you're confused about the meaning of "lazy" in R programming, you might benefit from this blog post by Maëlle Salmon, Athanasia Mo Mowinckel and Hannah Frick on the R-hub blog: [Lazy introduction to laziness in R](https://blog.r-hub.io/2025/02/13/lazy-meanings/).

### Find missing .Rd tags with {checkhelper}

The [checkhelper package](https://thinkr-open.r-universe.dev/checkhelper) by [Sébastien Rochette](/author/sébastien-rochette/) helps you identify missing documentation pieces before a submission to CRAN: for instance, missing `@return`.
There might be false positives, for instance if you document several functions on a single page with the same `@return` ([issue](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/checkhelper/issues/84)) but it's nonetheless a handy tool when preparing a CRAN submission.
