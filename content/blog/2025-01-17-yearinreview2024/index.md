In 2024, we worked towards our commitment to open science and open source software. 
We continued to build a welcoming and inclusive community, through innovation and collaboration. 

We went through a leadership transition, Karthik Ram stepped down as Executive Director after 13 years of service, transitioning the role to Noam Ross, ensuring continued focus on strategic goals and community impact.

Here are the highlights of the year:

## 1. R-Universe Enhancements

R-Universe, rOpenSci's platform for hosting, building, and distributing R packages, saw remarkable advancements in 2024, 
making it a robust and user-friendly platform for developers and researchers.

The platform introduced MacOS ARM64 binaries support for Apple Silicon, WebAssembly Rust integration , opening new doors for cross-platform and browser-based R applications,
and Quarto Integration for Vignettes, providing a more flexible and modern way for developers to document their packages and share insights with users.

We received a Google Season of Docs grant, aimed at overhauling and centralizing its documentation. 
The project focused on consolidating numerous tech notes and READMEs into a unified and easily navigable Quarto website, 
highlighting best practices and guiding users to maximize the platform's features.

R-Universe is currently serving _25887_ packages,
_22130_ articles, and 
_63391_ datasets by 
_1232_ organizations,
_13460_ maintainers and 
_21654_ contributors.

Finally, [R-Universe has been named R Consortium’s Top-Level Project in 2024](/blog/2024/12/03/r-universe-r-consortium-tlp/), ensuring support for three years,
not only recognizing its impact on the R community and the broader open-source ecosystem but 
also providing resources to further develop and maintain the platform.

## 2. Software Peer Review

In 2024, rOpenSci’s software peer review program continued to grow, 
showcasing the commitment to improving software quality and 
validating R packages for a variety of applications. 

We’ve had **17** packages successfully complete software peer review with the help of about 33 reviewers 
and 11 editors, with [2 new editors]().

Continued refinement of the peer-review process to ensure efficiency and thoroughness 
while supporting package authors and reviewers. Regular updates on the number of submissions, 
approvals, and the status of packages under review were shared through newsletters, our Slack and 
our open GitHub organization, reinforcing the program’s transparency and community involvement.


## 3.  
We have 219 contribuntors and 49 of those people made their first code contribution to rOpenSci during 2024! 
Others shared xx new use cases to help package authors see how their work is 
being used and help other users imagine how they can apply it.
