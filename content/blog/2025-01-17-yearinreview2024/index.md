In 2024, we worked towards our commitment to open science and open source software. 
We continued to build a welcoming and inclusive community, through innovation and collaboration. 

We went through a leadership transition, Karthik Ram stepped down as Executive Director after 13 years of service, transitioning the role to Noam Ross, ensuring continued focus on strategic goals and community impact.

Here are the highlights of the year:

## 1. **R-Universe Enhancements**

R-Universe, rOpenSci's platform for hosting, building, and distributing R packages, saw remarkable advancements in 2024, 
making it a robust and user-friendly platform for developers and researchers.

The platform introduced MacOS ARM64 binaries support for Apple Silicon, WebAssembly Rust integration , opening new doors for cross-platform and browser-based R applications,
and Quarto Integration for Vignettes, providing a more flexible and modern way for developers to document their packages and share insights with users.

R-Universe received a Google Season of Docs grant, aimed at overhauling and centralizing its documentation. 
The project focused on consolidating numerous tech notes and READMEs into a unified and easily navigable Quarto website, 
highlighting best practices and guiding users to maximize the platform's features.
