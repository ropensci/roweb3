In 2024, we worked towards our commitment to open science and open source software. 
We continued to build a welcoming and inclusive community, through innovation and collaboration. 

We went through a leadership transition, [Karthik Ram stepped down as Executive Director](/blog/2024/03/29/from-the-founding-director-my-farewell-to-ropensci/) after 13 years 
of service, [transitioning the role to Noam Ross](/blog/2024/03/29/hello-from-our-new-executive-director/), 
ensuring continued focus on strategic goals and community impact.

Here are the highlights of the year:

## 1. R-Universe Enhancements

R-Universe, rOpenSci's platform for hosting, building, and distributing R packages, 
saw remarkable advancements in 2024, 
making it a robust and user-friendly platform for developers and researchers.

The platform introduced MacOS ARM64 binaries support, making our tools more efficient 
for developers using Apple Silicon devices. We also integrated Rust into the WebAssembly toolchain, 
opening up exciting possibilities for browser-based R applications, 
and Quarto Integration for Vignettes, 
providing a more flexible and modern way for developers to document their packages 
and share insights with users.

We received a Google Season of Docs grant, aimed at overhauling and centralizing its documentation. 
The project focused on consolidating numerous tech notes and READMEs into a unified and easily navigable Quarto website, 
highlighting best practices and guiding users to maximize the platform's features.

R-Universe is currently serving _25887_ packages,
_22130_ articles, and 
_63391_ datasets by 
_1232_ organizations,
_13460_ maintainers and 
_21654_ contributors.

Finally, [R-Universe has been named R Consortium’s Top-Level Project in 2024](/blog/2024/12/03/r-universe-r-consortium-tlp/), ensuring support for three years,
not only recognizing its impact on the R community and the broader open-source ecosystem but 
also providing resources to further develop and maintain the platform.

## 2. Software Peer Review

In 2024, rOpenSci’s software peer review program continued to grow, 
showcasing the commitment to improving software quality and 
validating R packages for a variety of applications. 

We’ve had **17** packages successfully complete software peer review with the help of about **33** reviewers 
and **11** editors, with [2 new editors](/blog/2024/07/03/editors2024/).

We also streamlined the review process and provided transparency through regular updates
on the number of submissions, approvals, 
and the status of packages under review were shared through newsletters, 
our Slack and our open GitHub organization. 
Peer review remains a cornerstone of how we maintain quality and reproducibility in R software development
and how we build community.


## 3. Multilingual Resources

In 2024, rOpenSci continued to expand its multilingual resources, 
the ["rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review" guide was updated 
to include Spanish translations](/blog/2024/03/11/devguide-0.9.0/). 
Additionally, [Portuguese translations are underway](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/projects/7), 
supported by dedicated community volunteers.

Tools like [babeldown](https://docs.ropensci.org/babeldown/) and [babelquarto](https://docs.ropensci.org/babelquarto/) 
were spotlighted for enabling collaborative translation efforts, 
helping the community localize resources efficiently. 
Our first traslathon jointly done with the conference LatinR was 
an opportunity to learn how to use this tools "by doing" and made progress 
on our translation projects.

We shared our experiences and tools in several conferences (and several languages) and also 
discussed the importance of multilingual computing materials 
in an episode of the ["Code for Thought" podcast]().

We close the year introducing the [rOpenSci Localization and Translation Guidelines](/blog/2024/12/17/localization-guide/) in Spanish and English 
to assist our community, but also other groups in translating and localizing open science resources. 


## 4. Community Engagement

We have 219 contributors and 49 of those people made their first code contribution to rOpenSci during 2024! 
Others shared xx new use cases to help package authors see how their work is 
being used and help other users imagine how they can apply it.



We also celebrated our vibrant package ecosystem with the “A Package a Day” 
campaign on Mastodon and Weekly Package digests in LinkedIn. 
These efforts showcased the incredible diversity of our over 300 federated open-source packages.
