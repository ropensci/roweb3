In 2024, we worked towards our commitment to open science and open source software. 
We continued to build a welcoming and 
inclusive community, through innovation and collaboration. 

Here are the highlights of the year:

## Leadership Transition

We went through a leadership transition, 
[Karthik Ram stepped down as Executive Director](/blog/2024/03/29/from-the-founding-director-my-farewell-to-ropensci/) 
after 13 years of service, 
[transitioning the role to Noam Ross](/blog/2024/03/29/hello-from-our-new-executive-director/), 
ensuring continued focus on strategic goals and community impact.



## R-Universe Enhancements

R-Universe, rOpenSci's platform for hosting, building, and distributing R packages, 
saw remarkable advancements in 2024, 
making it a robust and user-friendly platform for developers and researchers.

The platform introduced MacOS ARM64 binaries support, making our tools more efficient 
for developers using Apple Silicon devices. We also integrated Rust into the WebAssembly toolchain, 
opening up exciting possibilities for browser-based R applications, 
and Quarto Integration for Vignettes, 
providing a more flexible and modern way for developers to document their packages 
and share insights with users. You can check all the new features 
in the [R-Universe Community Call](/commcalls/nov2024-r-universe/).

We received a Google Season of Docs grant, aimed at overhauling and centralizing its documentation. 
The project focused on consolidating numerous tech notes and READMEs into a unified and easily navigable Quarto website, 
highlighting best practices and guiding users to maximize the platform's features.

R-Universe is currently serving _25887_ packages,
_22130_ articles, and 
_63391_ datasets by 
_1232_ organizations,
_13460_ maintainers and 
_21654_ contributors.

Finally, [R-Universe has been named R Consortium’s Top-Level Project in 2024](/blog/2024/12/03/r-universe-r-consortium-tlp/), ensuring support for three years,
not only recognizing its impact on the R community and the broader open-source ecosystem but 
also providing resources to further develop and maintain the platform.

## Software Peer Review

In 2024, rOpenSci’s software peer review program continued to grow, 
showcasing the commitment to improving software quality and 
validating R packages for a variety of applications. 

We’ve had **17** packages successfully complete software peer review with the help of about **33** reviewers 
and **11** editors, with [2 new editors](/blog/2024/07/03/editors2024/).

We also streamlined the review process and provided transparency through regular updates
on the number of submissions, approvals, 
and the status of packages under review were shared through newsletters, 
our Slack and our open GitHub organization. 
Peer review remains a cornerstone of how we maintain quality and reproducibility in R software development
and how we build community.


## Multilingual Resources

In 2024, rOpenSci continued to expand its multilingual resources, 
the ["rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review" 
guide was updated to include Spanish translations](/blog/2024/03/11/devguide-0.9.0/). 
Additionally, [Portuguese translations are underway](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/projects/7), 
supported by dedicated community volunteers.

We continue de development of tools like 
[babeldown](https://docs.ropensci.org/babeldown/),
[babelquarto](https://docs.ropensci.org/babelquarto/) and
our [rOpenSci Localization and Translation Guidelines](/blog/2024/12/17/localization-guide/) 
in Spanish and English to assist our community, 
but also other groups in translating and localizing open science resources. 

Community discussions on multilingual publishing, 
like our [first Portuguese Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/translation-portuguese/) and
our first _Traslathon_, reinforced the 
importance of breaking language barriers in open science. 

It’s been inspiring to see the enthusiasm from contributors 
and volunteers driving this effort forward.

We also shared our experiences and tools in several conferences 
(and several languages) and also discussed the importance 
of multilingual computing materials in an episode of 
the ["Code for Thought" podcast](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/14660478-en-crossing-the-language-barrier-yanina-saibene).


## 5. Champions Program

The [second cohort of the Champions Program](/blog/2024/02/15/champions-program-champions-2024/) has been inspiring. 
These leaders have tackled projects that span disciplines and geographies, 
driving open science and open data initiatives with creativity and 
local impact.

Package development is the type of project most chosen by this group, 
but we have champions who have also been reviewers for our peer-review.

Multilingualism plays an important role in the Champions Program, 
as part of their outreach activity, this year we have events and workshops
in [Turkish](/events/rsr-learn-and-use/), 
[Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYfyBrQhMQc), 
[Portuguese](https://www.eventbrite.cl/e/traducao-hackathon-traslaton-ropensci-tickets-1045507530167),
Chinese and, of course,
English.

Finally, [we got the support of the CZI program to continue with the
Champions Program with a regional focus in Latin America](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/10/10/czi-latam-grant/), carrying out
the program in Spanish and Portuguese.

We are excited to see the impact of our Champions' projects 
and the new cohort of Champions in 2025.

## 6. Community Engagement

We have 219 contributors and 49 of those people made their first code contribution to rOpenSci during 2024! 
Others shared xx new use cases to help package authors see how their work is 
being used and help other users imagine how they can apply it.

Our blog had featured many different voices and experiences during 2024.
We have a total of 35 community authors, of which 18 are first time community authors!
Counting our staff, 42 authors wrote 54 blog posts, 63% of which were written by community authors
and 13% were multilingual.

We also celebrated our vibrant package ecosystem with the “A Package a Day” 
campaign on Mastodon and Weekly Package digests in LinkedIn. 
These efforts showcased the incredible diversity of our over 
300 federated open-source packages.

Community Calls and virtual social coworking and office hours 
brought together people from at least 20 countries to leanr,
get their own work done 
and to join in some spirited scavenger hunts! 

Many others have continued to [read our newsletter](https://ropensci.org/news/), 
cite our software, 
[ask or answer questions](https://discuss.ropensci.org), 
open issues to report bugs or request features, 
weigh in on standards and best practices, 
invited us [to talk about our work](https://ropensci.org/talks-papers/), 
or mentioned us in a presentation, a post, or social media.


## Looking Ahead

Firts of all, a **big thank you all for making rOpenSci**. 
We are very grateful for your contribution and look forward 
to continue working together in 2025. 

We also look forward to another year of growth, and collaboration
with other organizations and communities 
we have been working like Epiverse, RECON, data.org, 
LatinR, PyOpenSci, OpenScapes and OSPO Offices.

We start 2025 with a [Community Call](/commcalls/first-time-contributor/) 
and [mini-hackathons](/coworking/) 
during our co-working session to support first-time contributors 
to open source projects.
These calls provided invaluable opportunities for 
knowledge-sharing, networking and skill-up opportunity in a
safe and friendly space underscoring the collaborative spirit of rOpenSci.

See you all around!
