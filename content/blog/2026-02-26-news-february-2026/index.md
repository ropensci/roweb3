Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup! <!-- blabla --> You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2026/02/17/news-february-2026). Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

### The R Foundation on OSS

The R Foundation answered a [Call for Evidence from the EU about open-source](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/16213-European-Open-Digital-Ecosystems_en), after asking for examples of the added value of R in the public or private sectors. You can read the [full response of the R Foundation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/16213-European-Open-Digital-Ecosystems/F33370610_en), including a discussion of useful ideas for the future of R and open-source in general.

### On sitrep (situation report) functions

Athanasia Monika Mowinckel wrote a post on [sitrep functions](https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2026/sitrep-functions/): functions that help the user check their setup and provide them with useful diagnostics. The blog post includes two examples.

### New version of the jarl CLI

The jarl CLI by Etienne Bacher "finds inefficient, hard-to-read, and suspicious patterns of R code across dozens of files and thousands of lines of code in milliseconds". Read about the new features in [jarl 0.4.0](https://www.etiennebacher.com/posts/2026-02-03-jarl-0.4.0/), like the ability to find "unreachable code".

### futurize R package

Henrik Bengtsson released [futurize](https://www.jottr.org/2026/01/22/futurize-0.1.0/) that allows you to parallelize execution with minimal changes to code, by simply adding a call to `futurize()`: `y <- lapply(x, fcn) |> futurize()`.

### On AI agents and open-source

Scott Shambaugh, an open-source maintainer, wrote about his being targeted by an AI agent after closing a PR for an issue that was intended for human newbies. Initial blog post: ["An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me"](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/), [Updated](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-2/).
