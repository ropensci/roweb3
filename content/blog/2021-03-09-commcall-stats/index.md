A week ago we held a [Community Call](/commcalls/feb2021-statsreview/) discussing rOpenSci Statistical Software Testing and Peer Review. 
This call included speakers [Noam Ross](/author/noam-ross/) [Mark Padgham](/author/mark-padgham), [Anna Krystalli](/author/anna-krystalli), [Alex Hayes](/author/alex-hayes) and [John Sakaluk](/author/john-sakaluk). 

{{< figure src = "speakers.png" class = "center" width = "600" alt = "Headshots of the moderator and four panelists">}}

The call started out...

Introduced the packages autotest and srr which do...

Then finished by...

Here we've organized the video content by speakers and questions, including links to the specific time points in the [video](https://vimeo.com/518761488) as well as to questions and answers in the [collaborative document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o933nG1ZW2Qf8p7FdQxn8wOkk9qoBINL1fx3FlIFSJU/) that we include in every community call. 
We hope that by preparing this summary, more people will be able to benefit from this information.

### Questions

- (Anna) Suggestion of RStudio addin for srr ([video](https://vimeo.com/518761488#t=38m47s))

- (Anna) Could we get more detail on what autotest looks for? ([video](https://vimeo.com/518761488#t=39m45s) | [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o933nG1ZW2Qf8p7FdQxn8wOkk9qoBINL1fx3FlIFSJU/edit#heading=h.so3v8xc34myn))

- (Steffi) Is autotest applicable to all packages or just statistical packages? ([video](https://vimeo.com/518761488#t=43m11s) | [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o933nG1ZW2Qf8p7FdQxn8wOkk9qoBINL1fx3FlIFSJU/edit#heading=h.4th2qtdafspr))

- (Joss) We are just beginning to re-code some existing packages - so have the advantage of starting with a blank sheet AND a good specification AND well tested code snippets. We're new to this community - what advice would give on both engagement and coding? ([video](https://vimeo.com/518761488#t=49m07s) | [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o933nG1ZW2Qf8p7FdQxn8wOkk9qoBINL1fx3FlIFSJU/edit#heading=h.fvjzqwqcf88u))

- (John) Regarding representation in the program, do we have any sense where groups of folks are over/under-represented within specific areas? ([video](https://vimeo.com/518761488#t=53m27s) | [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o933nG1ZW2Qf8p7FdQxn8wOkk9qoBINL1fx3FlIFSJU/edit#heading=h.xnstfjt1cjg7))

- (Rafael) What is the vision for applying these srr standards to existing (previously published) rOpenSci packages ([video](https://vimeo.com/518761488#t=55m40s) | [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o933nG1ZW2Qf8p7FdQxn8wOkk9qoBINL1fx3FlIFSJU/edit#heading=h.78ydzxagwubi))

- (Charles) Does autotest take into account dependencies and dependency changes? ([document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o933nG1ZW2Qf8p7FdQxn8wOkk9qoBINL1fx3FlIFSJU/edit#heading=h.s52f459a2yp1))
