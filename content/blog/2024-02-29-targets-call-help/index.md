preface: |
  One of the best things about open software is that it can be a community project with contributions from people other than just the maintainer.
  Sometimes those contributions are opportunistic, and sometimes maintainers solicit specific contributions, and that’s the case here!

The package [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets) maintained by [Will Landau](/author/will-landau), and its companion packages, are pipeline tools, that coordinate the pieces of computationally demanding analysis projects.

## Help sustain targets discussion forums!

Are you a routined user of the targets package and of more [targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/) packages? 
How about helping answer users questions on the GitHub discussion and issue forums for these packages? 
This would help lighten the maintenance load of those packages, and you’d get to help other users directly.
