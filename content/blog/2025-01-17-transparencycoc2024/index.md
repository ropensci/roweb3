The rOpenSci community is supported by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) 
with a clear description of unacceptable behaviors, 
instructions on how to make a report, 
and information on how reports are handled. 
We, the Code of Conduct Committee, 
are responsible for receiving, investigating, deciding, 
enforcing and reporting on all reports of potential violations of our Code. 
We are committed to transparency with our community while upholding the privacy 
of people who experience or report incidents.

In 2024, we received one Code of Conduct incident report. 

### Summary of reported incident

We received a Code of Conduct report regarding sharing a message in Slack. 
After review, we found that the original message did not violate the Code of Conduct guidelines. 
However, one response to the message was considered inappropriate and was addressed by
the Community Manager by making a visible response in the message thread.
