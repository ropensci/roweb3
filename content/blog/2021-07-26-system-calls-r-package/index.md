Have you ever found a command-line tool that's perfect for getting your job done, and wanted to use it from an R script or package?
E.g. some sort of scientific software providing a specific functionality made available though a command-line interface (CLI)?

In this post, we shall show some options for writing such CLI wrappers in R.
In particular, we compare the base R functions `system()` and `system2()`, the [sys](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sys/) package and the [processx](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/processx/) package.

But we start with some words of caution about the limitations of this approach, and explaining when, and how, to _not_ shell out, and try to find an alternative interface.

## Downsides of system commands

When possible, it is usually better to use a C, C++ (or even JS, Python...) interface to interact with external software, rather than calling a command-line interface (CLI).
Interfacing to external software via a foreign language API is usually more robust and performant than via a CLI.

The core issue is that each system command starts a new process.
Because processes don't share memory, the only interaction via R and the shell program is via free text streams (pipes) between R and the child process.
This makes it cumbersome to exchange data, handle exceptions, and control the program execution from R. Let's explore this in more detail.

### Data input and output

A C/C++ library has formal functions with one or more arguments and a return value, each consisting of typed data structures. You can call such a C/C++ API from an R package, passing data from R objects into the library and back, in a very similar as when calling functions from the R package itself.

On the other hand, the only input to a shell command is a single string with the command line arguments.
Most programs that need actual input data will need to read this from file(s) on disk, in some particular format, which can lead to performance overhead or read/write errors.

When the user has to provide the command arguments (e.g. filenames) to be passed to the command line program,
you have to consider these names could contain spaces or non-ascii characters.
This can again lead to bugs when they get joined into the shell command that is invoked by R.

### Progress and exception handling

The output of a command line program only consists of an exit code (an integer indicating if the execution was successful) and two text streams which the program prints to the screen. When invoked from R, we can capture these text streams, which results in two large strings, in addition to the exit code. This is all that we get back from executing a system command.

Hence, there is no return object, or exception handling if a problem appears in called program.
This means that if we interface with a CLI tool in R and an error appears, the best we can do is to show the output text from the program to the user; we cannot programmatically handle errors.

Because we have no shared memory, there is also no good way for R to inspect or control the command line program while it is running. From the R point of view, the external program is basically a black box.

### The alternative: foreign language interfaces

If the software you need provides an alternative interface, or a similar program exists that does, this might provide a better basis than a CLI tool.

When possible, the most robust way to interface with external libraries is via C or C++. Because R itself is written in C, calling a C or C++ library takes almost zero overhead. To get started with wrapping C libraries, check out [Davis Vaughan's blog post](https://blog.davisvaughan.com/2019/03/02/now-you-c-me/). For C++ dive into either [Rcpp](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html) or the more recent [cpp11](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/cpp11.html).

Examples of rOpenSci packages interfacing to C/C++ interfaces include [magick](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick) (imagemagick), [pdftools](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools) (poppler), [ijtiff](https://docs.ropensci.org/ijtiff) (libtiff), [gert](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert) (libgit2), and many more. The "system dependencies" column in the [r-universe dashboard](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/) shows the C/C++ libraries that R package are interfacing with.

Some software does not provide a C/C++ API but can be called via Python or JavaScript. In this case, you could use [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) or [V8](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/vignettes/v8_intro.html) to create an R wrapper. Running external software through Python or JavaScript is not quite as performant as C/C++, but reticulate and V8 provide a solid bridge to exchange data and exceptions, so these packages are often more reliable than a CLI wrapper.

## Several methods of calling a CLI program from R

Now that we have warned you, let's move on to the main topic of this post: how to call a CLI program from R. We show 3 increasingly advanced ways to invoke a system command (a.k.a "shell out") from R:

* `system()` or `system2()` functions in base R
* the [sys](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sys/index.html) package
* the [processx](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/processx/index.html) package

Depending on your needs you may prefer one or another solution.

### Base system/system2

Base-R provides functions `system` and `system2`. The R [source code](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/c65ce1f39fa9b831490e384a567c3bcab7b81141/src/library/base/R/unix/system.unix.R#L19-L52) for these functions is self-explanatory: all the arguments and options are combined into one big shell command, which is then passed to a local shell (`sh` on unix or `cmd` on Windows).
For example, if you run this in R:

```r
system2("whoami", stdout = TRUE)
## [1] "jeroen"
```

R will [convert this](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/c65ce1f39fa9b831490e384a567c3bcab7b81141/src/library/base/R/unix/system.unix.R#L80-L87) into the shell command that writes output to a temporary file, such as below. After the command exists with success, R tries to read the file and return the content.

```
whoami > /tmp/RtmpnMXhzK/fileef2a84a02fb68 2>&1
```

But during the program execution, we don't know what is going on; R blocks and waits for the command to finish, as long as it takes. This is fine for simple programs, but for complex long running commands, it can be nice to have more control and insight in the progress or intermediate output from the process.

### The sys package

The [sys package](https://github.com/jeroen/sys#sys) is a small powerful package (mostly C code without dependencies) to run commands. The package is designed to mimic `system2` but the internals are more sophisticated to give better control over the running process. For example we can use a callback function to handle stdout/stderr text _immediately while it is being printed by the program_, and finally return the exit code for the process:

```r
res <- sys::exec_wait("whoami", std_out = function(x){
  cat("My name is:", rawToChar(x))
})
## My name is: jeroen

res
## [0]
```

The package can also handle binary (non text) stdout/stderr, and has various other APIs that are useful when invoking complex programs. The `exec_internal()` function buffers and return all the stdout/stderr output back to R (but without ever writing to a file):

```r
out <- sys::exec_internal('whoami')
out
## $status
## [1] 0
## 
## $stdout
## [1] 6a 65 72 6f 65 6e 0a
## 
## $stderr
## raw(0)

rawToChar(out$stdout)
## [1] "jeroen\n"
```

Note that the stdout here contains a raw vector, because the package supports binary output as well. You can use `rawToChar()` or `sys::as_text()` to convert a raw vector this into a string.

Sys also provides basic functionality to spawn a background process with `exec_background()` however for this case the processx package may be better suited.

### The processx package

The [processx package](https://processx.r-lib.org/reference/index.html) is much more advanced than base or sys. It provides a very extensive framework for executing and controlling many processes simultaneously from R. The `processx::run()` function implements the simple execute-and-wait scenario similar to system2 or sys, (but with [many more options](https://processx.r-lib.org/reference/run.html)):

```r
processx::run('whoami')
## $status
## [1] 0
## 
## $stdout
## [1] "jeroen\n"
## 
## $stderr
## [1] ""
## 
## $timeout
## [1] FALSE
```

Where processx really stands out is the capability to manage execution of many concurrent background processes, without blocking R. It provides an [extensive API](https://processx.r-lib.org/reference/process.html) for launching and controlling processes through objects of a special `process` class. 

```r
library(processx)
p <- process$new("sleep", "2")
p$is_alive()
## [1] TRUE
p
## PROCESS 'sleep', running, pid 5376.
p$kill()
p$is_alive()
## [1] FALSE
```

Processx makes it possible to implement [very advanced things in R](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/09/processx-3.2.0/#advanced-usage-background-processes), such as a multicore webserver or parallel processing framework, but it is much more complicated than base-R or sys.


## Conclusion

In this post we have shown a few ways to execute system commands in R.

In [rOpenSci Software Peer-Review](/software-review/), at the moment of writing, Scientific Software Wrappers is a category [in scope](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#package-categories).

>  Packages that wrap non-R utility programs used for scientific research. These programs must be specific to research fields, not general computing utilities. Wrappers must be non-trivial, in that there must be significant added value above simple system() call or bindings, whether in parsing inputs and outputs, data handling, etc. Improved installation process, or extension of compatibility to more platforms, may constitute added value if installation is complex. This does not include wrappers of other R packages or C/C++ libraries that can be included in R packages. We strongly encourage wrapping open-source and open-licensed utilities - exceptions will be evaluated case-by-case, considering whether open-source options exist.
