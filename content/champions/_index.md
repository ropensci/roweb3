## Open Call for rOpenSci Champions Program 2023 Applications! 

{{< figure src = "/images/volunteer/peep8.png" width = "300" alt = "A person with his dog working on a notebook." class = "pull-left" >}}

Research software *should serve everyone in our communities*, which means it needs to be *sustainable, open, and built by and for all groups*. Currently, however, there is a dismaying lack of diversity in open source communities in general and the R / research software community in particular. Developers in the R community are overwhelmingly white, male, and from a handful of countries. That disappointing lack of diversity is potentially detrimental to the sustainability, utility and productivity of projects.

The *rOpenSci Champions Program* is for **people from historically and systematically excluded groups** who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and open science communities.

The rOpenSci Champion Program [is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/) and is supported through a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
