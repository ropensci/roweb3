Research software _should serve everyone in our communities_, which means it needs to be _sustainable, open, and built by and for all groups_. Currently, however, there is a dismaying lack of diversity in open source communities in general and the R / research software community in particular. Developers in the R community are overwhelmingly white, male, and from a handful of countries. That disappointing lack of diversity is potentially detrimental to the sustainability, utility and productivity of projects. 

The _rOpenSci Champions Program_ is for __people from historically and systematically excluded groups__ who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and open science communities.

The rOpenSci Champion Program [is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/) and is supported through a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

## Program goals

In its inaugural year, the _rOpenSci Champions Program_ aims to support R developers, from around the world, and who identify themselves as members of a group that is systematically excluded from the open software community to:

* Gain the skills to develop their own R package or;
* Gain confidence in submitting an R package for peer review or become a reviewer.
* Learn how to lead a workshop or other event about package development or software peer review -  or another rOpenSci activity - in their local community.
* Connect with a supportive network of peers and mentors within the R ecosystem.
* Provide feedback to help rOpenSci to continue to host relevant, welcoming activities for R developers.
* Gain transferable skills and experiences that are sought after for careers in open source software.

We are looking six to nine Champions for this first pilot. We expect to co-create the rOpenSci Champion program with the selected applicants and influence future editions with their experience and feedback.

We look forward to receiving many applications and are committed to directing non-selected applicants towards other ways in which they can contribute to rOpenSci.

## About the program

The rOpenSci Champions Program is a 12-month-long program including cohort-based training, project development, and personal mentorship.

Champions will participate in:

    - how to plan and facilitate engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success,
    - knowledge of various channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and
    - technical skills in software development and review.

* Personal and group mentorship:

    - A series of meetings with mentors;
    - Quarterly cohort calls.

## Program expectations

{{< figure src = "/images/volunteer/peep6.png" width = "300" alt = "A person with his dog working on a notebook." class = "pull-left" >}}

Champions are expected to complete training and attend meetings with their mentors and cohorts. After training, Champions will develop their own project. Projects may involve building a new package or going through the peer review process as an author or a reviewer.

Champions will also choose and perform several activities, such as running recruitment activities, giving presentations, writing blog posts, and organizing peer groups in their communities.

It is expected that Champions will promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation. They will also gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate.

The estimated time commitment for each Champion is, on average, __10 hours per month__  (including trainings, cohort events, mentoring meetings, package development or review process, and preparing for and hosting events). The total time commitment for each Champion will vary based on the path and activities they choose to do during the program.
