Research software *should serve everyone in our communities*, which means it needs to be *sustainable, open, and built by and for all groups*.
Currently, however, there is a dismaying lack of diversity in open source communities in general and the R / research software community in particular.
Developers in the R community are overwhelmingly white, male, and from a handful of countries.
That disappointing lack of diversity is potentially detrimental to the sustainability, utility and productivity of projects.

The *rOpenSci Champions Program* is for **people from historically and systematically excluded groups** who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and open science communities.

The rOpenSci Champion Program [is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/) and is supported through a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

The program is a 12-month-long program that includes onboarding, cohort-based training, one-on-one mentorship, cohort meetings, project development, outreach activities, assessment, and offboarding.
After training, Champions develop their project.
Projects may involve**building a new package or going through the peer review process as an author or a reviewer**.
As the concluding activity of the training, champions choose at least one of several outreach options to perform, which include giving a presentation, writing a blog post, or organizing a peer group in their community.
Some of our cohorts are language and geographic region-specific.
