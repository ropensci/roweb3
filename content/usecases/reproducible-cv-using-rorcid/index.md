#### What did you do? 
A curriculum vitae is really a set of lists. It would be fantastic to have a reproducible CV that capitalizes on R to re-populate works to a table. I examined the capacity of rorcid as a mechanism to scrape works from my ORCID profile, tidy a bit include filter to papers only for now, and then pull that table into an R Markdown and knit out a clean CV to pdf. Seems like a viable strategy.  I co-tested wosr as an alternative. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wosr/index.html
Numerous advantages to rorcid package.
