#### What did you do? 
I used the package, with the help of its maintainer @adamhsparks, to download rainfall data for specific time periods matching the pre- and early-season of period of soybean growth in Brazil. It will be further used to explore associations between rainfall and patterns of dispersal of a fungal disease of soybean over large region across years.
