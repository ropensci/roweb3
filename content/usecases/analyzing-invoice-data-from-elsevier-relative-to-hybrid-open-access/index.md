**What did you do?**

I used several rOpenSci packages to mine Elsevier full-texts for invoice data relative to open access articles in hybrid journals. Such evidence is critical to keep track of funding streams for open access publications. Academic publishers rarely make publication fee spending for hybrid journals transparent. Surprisingly, Elsevier is a notable exception sharing this data.
