title: Use Cases
---

If youâ€™re looking for examples of how our R packages or resources have been used, search no more! 
We collect [use cases in a public forum](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/discussions/categories) and we created a template there to help you share yours. 
Below is a random subset as well as a searchable archive of all use cases. 
Browse them, and [report your own use case(s)](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/discussions/categories). 
For more illustrations of our packages' use, also see the [citations page](/citations).
