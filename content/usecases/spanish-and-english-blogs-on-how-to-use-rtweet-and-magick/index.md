#### rOpenSci package or resource used

[rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet), [magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick)

#### What did you do? 

I like to use `rtweet` when I'm at conferences to look for impactful tweets and tweeters to follow or mute. I also enjoy using `magick` to add images to figures. 

After a conference, I happened to sit next to two conference attendee and I showed them my R code and my analysis. They encouraged me to write a blog post about how to use this tool, so I wrote this [blog post in English](https://www.raynamharris.com/blog/sacnas_rtweet/). Then I translated the human-readable parts of the code and published the [blog in Spanish](https://www.raynamharris.com/blog/sacnas_rtweet_es/). I shared both blogs [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/1192510904828432384) and they were well received.
