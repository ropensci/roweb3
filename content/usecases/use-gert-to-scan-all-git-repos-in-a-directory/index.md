#### rOpenSci package or resource used*

- [gert](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/)

#### What did you do? 

- wrote a function that scans a directory looking for git repositories that may need to be pushed to (or pulled from) github
- this example is based on the `git_ahead_behind()` command but it could easily generalise to other kinds of checks
