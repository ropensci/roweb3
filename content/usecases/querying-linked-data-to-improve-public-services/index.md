#### What did you do?   
The [ghql](https://docs.ropensci.org/ghql/) package was used to retrieve open data held in a triple store that was queryable with [CubiQL](https://github.com/Swirrl/cubiql), a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) service. The data was visualised in a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application that formed part of a suite of apps used in the [Trafford Workless Pilot](http://www.trafforddatalab.io/opengovintelligence/). The pilot was part of the EU funded Horizon 2020 [OpenGovIntelligence](http://www.opengovintelligence.eu/) project that used linked data to improve public services.
