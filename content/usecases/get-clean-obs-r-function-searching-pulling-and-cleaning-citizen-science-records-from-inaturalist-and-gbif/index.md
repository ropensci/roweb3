An R function that leverages the rgbif and spocc packages to search for, pull down, combine and clean records of a single species (with lat/lon bounding boxes). A continuing work in progress, but hopefully useful for folks interested in pulling records from these sources. It also has some (slow, but tricky) work arounds when querying large numbers (up to 200k) from these sources.
