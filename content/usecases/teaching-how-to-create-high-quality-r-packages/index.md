#### What did you do? 
the [University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/) one of the courses we teach is called [DSCI 524 Collaborative Software Development](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_524_collab-sw-dev). In this course, students have to work in teams of 3-4 to create a R package (among other things). One of the resources we recommend the students use for this is the [rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) guide. In particular, we encourage the students to go through the [Review template](https://devguide.ropensci.org/reviewtemplate.html) in the appendix of that guide before they hand in their R package for final grading. Instructors and Teaching Assistants for this course also use this [Review template](https://devguide.ropensci.org/reviewtemplate.html) to help give both formative feedback and guide summative assessment.
