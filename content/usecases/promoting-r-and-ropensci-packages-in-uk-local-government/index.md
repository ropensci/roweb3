#### Description

[Trafford Council's](https://www.trafford.gov.uk) [Trafford Data Lab](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/) are publishing [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) [recipes](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/recipes/) for local government colleagues. The aim of the project is to embed an analytical workflow across UK local government that encourages openness, reproducibility and collaboration by promoting the use of R. We've used and plan to use a number of rOpenSci packages in the recipes including [ropenaq](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ropenaq/index.html) and [fingertipsR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fingertipsR/index.html). These particular packages provide an intuitive way of retrieving open data within R without the need to familiarise yourself with often complex APIs.

We actively encourage other UK local government employees to submit their own R recipes for routine analytical tasks. A recipe template is available to download from [here](https://github.com/traffordDataLab/recipes/raw/master/template.Rmd). When you’ve completed your recipe just send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) on [GitHub](https://github.com/traffordDataLab/recipes).
