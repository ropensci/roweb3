#### What did you do? 
I made a 13,424 page website, <https://collegetables.info/>, to compare US colleges; it tracks things like graduation rates and finances over time, as well as distributions of degrees by fields. It was featured in the *New York Times* ([gift link](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/15/your-money/college-cost-data-tools.html?unlocked_article_code=hN2IwBdFONp5CmgbxhKM-HVUid0P2EEoomfIcGniJ6EcogeoxOwoimKabx7gynOb0f6-QxIpIELuqqT35rk-nLmDMZMDAljFtcY-YQBvNGWVgLCKOj7omvSxUjcQbXnG4B8H67gTFWQA8USo6Y3Xs5RWuXjQ8Chp2WchftGv-k9oTf7m0nPvki2JmPoQiawOquJTtiwFG9lxEX5-vSzJIvBPu5Gl_-jhW5wisUpTZCQWfzr9Ar56ix7q2rQ2B4qqyQxpPWqow2gJ_D0eF5c4PhAzh-QksTofGv9rUG0SJmgnDhUkCcF361B0kpugBjccqwqYBuaTbSFMqBowPacjapogDFA&giftCopy=1_CurrentCopy&smid=url-share)).
