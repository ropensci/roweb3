#### rOpenSci package or resource used*
[weathercan](https://docs.ropensci.org/weathercan/)

#### What did you do? 
I took my undergrad limnology class on a field trip to sample & characterize a local storm water retention pond in Brandon MB. Both weather and climate can provide important context when interpreting results. I used [Steffi's](https://twitter.com/steffilazerte/) [weathercan](https://docs.ropensci.org/weathercan/) package to get Environment and Climate Change Canada weather & climate data for [Brandon MB](https://twitter.com/CityBrandon/). I plotted up this data a few different ways and as a class we discussed how to best present this data.
