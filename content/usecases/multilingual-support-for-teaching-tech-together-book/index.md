We use babelquarto to add multilingual support to the second edition of the book Teaching Tech Together (Enseñar tenología en comunidad, in Spanish).  
This second edition is still a work in progress, and we start with the text in Spanish and then translate to English.  Book website: https://teachingtechtogether.netlify.app/
