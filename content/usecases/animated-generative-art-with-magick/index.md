This use case for {[magick](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/)} was inspired by the 'ashtree' algorithm by Danielle Navarro. I thought it would be really nice to show the organic growth of the trees. The tree itself is a result of a branching process, an excellent example for some simple generative art using functional programming. The animation can be admired [here](https://twitter.com/analythium/status/1251004527609708545).
