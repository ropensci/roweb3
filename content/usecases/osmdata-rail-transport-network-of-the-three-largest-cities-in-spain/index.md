#### rOpenSci package or resource used*
_[osmdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/)_

#### What did you do? 
_I combined several functions from the [osmdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/)  package to download the vector data for the street grid and rail transport network of the three largest cities in Spain (Madrid, Barcelona and València) and try to produce a nice-looking plot of these cities._
