#### rOpenSci package or resource used*
rtweet

#### What did you do? 
After the #30DayChartChallenge was over on April 30th, I wanted to make a summary of the twitter activity related to my tweets on the #30DayChartChallenge. All of the data for this analysis such as the tweets and user information were retrieved using rtweet, data wrangling done using tidyverse and visualization using ggplot2 and leaflet.
