#### What did you do? 
Much of the Canadian prairies is experiencing drought conditions (https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agriculture-and-environment/drought-watch-and-agroclimate/canadian-drought-monitor) resulting in significant wildfires and impacting agricultural production. I wanted to provide historical context for the current weather conditions.
