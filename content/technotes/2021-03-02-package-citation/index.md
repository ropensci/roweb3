As a package author you are probably happy to hear about its usage, and within academia, even more so if it is done with the usual currency of citations in scientific articles.

{{< tweet 1273605411577442304 >}}

In this post, we shall share tips on how to make your R package easy to cite, and some insights on obstacles the users of your package might face as well on our own literature surveillance.
We are writing this with the view of complementing our dev guide with the tips... and your feedback, so we are looking forward to your response!

## Clear citation rules for your lil' tool[^liltool]


## Why is it hard to cite software

Even once you have followed the tips above, well-meaning users of your package might stumble upon

* Journals with a limit on the number of references;

* Co-authors less willing to cite software than they are.

These problems can't be fixed at once by one motivated individual (neither you the developer nor they the user), so more advocacy is needed. Besides, in the meantime, how do we [adapt software citation guidelines](https://twitter.com/EikoFried/status/1197556604075466753) to realistically accommodate for all situations?

## How rOpenSci tracks package usage

## Conclusion

In this post we shared guidance on how to help your R package land in the references section of the papers that used it.
We also mentioned some hurdles even well-meaning users might face, and explained how we track for usage of our packages in the scientific literature.
We encourage you to share your experience and wisdom in the comments below, as we are planning to consolidate them together with our content, to add a new topic to our dev guide.

Note that this post is not about promoting _usage_ of your package, which is [covered briefly in the dev guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/marketing.html).

[^liltool]: This is a slightly snarky title responding to a [tweet](https://twitter.com/sk_emptyset/status/1261729463613693952) (isn't the use of "just" in "just a tool to access data" naive at best?). This lively thread also includes, in another place, an infamous [comparison of the tidyverse to a swivel chair](https://twitter.com/georgemsavva/status/1197122359515373574).
