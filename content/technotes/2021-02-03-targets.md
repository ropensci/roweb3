## What is `targets`?

rOpenSci's [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package is a new pipeline toolkit for R, and it just arrived on CRAN.

```r 
install.packages("targets")
```

{{< figure src = "targets.png" alt = "targets hex" class = "pull-left" >}}

[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) is the long-term successor of [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), which in turn succeeded [Rich FitzJohn](https://ropensci.org/author/rich-fitzjohn/)'s groundbreaking [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) package. [Click here](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/drake.html) to learn about the future of [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), the advantages of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), and how to transition. The [reference website](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) explains how to get started, and the [overview vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/articles/overview.html) describes the major features of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and its [user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).

## How it works

In [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), a data analysis pipeline is a collection of [target](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html) objects that [express the individual steps](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) of the workflow, from upstream data cleaning to downstream [R Markdown reports](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/files.html#literate-programming). These targets live in a special script called `_targets.R`.

```r 
# _targets.R file
library(targets)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr"))

# Most workflows have custom functions to support the targets.
read_clean <- function(path) {
  raw_data <- read_csv(path, col_types = cols())
  raw_data %>%
    mutate(Ozone = replace_na(Ozone, mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)))
}

fit_model <- function(data) {
  biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)
}

create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}

# List of targets.
list(
  tar_target(raw_data_file, "raw_data.csv", format = "file"),
  tar_target(data, read_clean(raw_data_file)),
  tar_target(fit, fit_model(data)),
  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data))
)
```



[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) inspects your code and constructs a dependency graph.

```r 
# R console
library(targets)
tar_visnetwork()
```

```{=html}

```

[`tar_make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make.html) runs the correct targets in the correct order.

```r 
# R console
tar_make()
```

```
#> ● run target raw_data_file
#> ● run target data
#> ● run target fit
#> ● run target hist
#> ● end pipeline
```

Alternatives [`tar_make_clustermq()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make_clustermq.html) and [`tar_make_future()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make_future.html) leverage [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/) and [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future), respectively, to distribute targets on traditional schedulers such as [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html), and it is only a matter of time before they become [cloud-capable](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Your results live either in the [`_targets/` data folder](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/files.html#internal-files) or in [Amazon S3 buckets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/cloud.html#storage), depending on your preferences. Regardless, the way to load the data back into R is the same.

```r 
# R console
tar_read(hist) # see also tar_load()
```
{{<figure src="2021-02-03-targetshistogram-1.png" alt="histogram">}}

Targets do not run if they are up to date, which saves countless hours of runtime in computationally intense fields like Bayesian data analysis and statistical genomics.

```r 
# R console
tar_make()
```

```
#> ✓ skip target raw_data_file
#> ✓ skip target data
#> ✓ skip target fit
#> ✓ skip target hist
#> ✓ skip pipeline
```

## The next challenge

To help workflows scale, [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) adopts the classical, pedantic, function-oriented worldview of R itself.

> Nearly everything that happens in R results from a function call. Therefore, basic programming centers on creating and refining functions [@chambers].

The more often you write your own functions to support your targets, the friendlier the package becomes.

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< tweet 1339443129930280960 >}}
<!--/html_preserve-->

But if your mind is on the domain knowledge, or if you are under pressure to work fast, then it can be hard to write functions for everything.

## Target factories

The best way to write fewer functions is to write less code. To write less code, we need strategic abstractions. A target factory is reusable shorthand to return an entire list of target objects, ideally from inside a package.

```r 
# script inside example.package

#' @export
read_clean <- function(path) {
  raw_data <- read_csv(path, col_types = cols())
  raw_data %>%
    mutate(Ozone = replace_na(Ozone, mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)))
}

#' @export
fit_model <- function(data) {
  biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)
}

#' @export
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}

#' @title Example target factory.
#' @description Concise shorthand to express our example pipeline.
#' @details
#'   Target factories should use `tar_target_raw()`.
#'   `tar_target()` is for users, and `tar_target_raw()` is for developers.
#'   The former quotes its arguments, while the latter evaluates them.
#' @export
biglm_factory <- function(file) {
  list(
    tar_target_raw("raw_data_file", as.expression(file), format = "file"),
    tar_target_raw("data", quote(example.package::read_clean(raw_data_file))),
    tar_target_raw("fit", quote(example.package::fit_model(data))),
    tar_target_raw("hist", quote(example.package::create_plot(data)))
  )
}
```

Our long `_targets.R` file suddenly collapses down to two lines.

```r 
# _targets.R file
library(example.package)
biglm_factory("raw_data.csv")
```

You have complete freedom to add more targets. 

```r 
# _targets.R file
library(example.package)
run_model2 <- function(data) {...}
list( # Target lists can be arbitrarily nested.
  biglm_factory("raw_data.csv"),
  tar_target(model2, run_model2(data))
)
```

## The R Targetopia

{{< figure src = "targetopia.png" alt = "targetopia hex" class = "pull-left" >}}

The [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/) is an emerging ecosystem of packages with target factories, and they make [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) easier to use for specific domains of Statistics and data science.

### `stantargets`

[`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/) abstracts away most of the targets and functions required for a solid Bayesian data analysis with [Stan](https://mc-stan.org). With a single [target factory](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories) and a single function to generate data, [`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/) gives you an entire sensitivity analysis or an entire [simulation-based calibration study](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc_rep.html) [@cook2006; @talts2020].

```r 
# _targets.R for simulation-based calibration to validate a Stan model.
library(targets)
library(stantargets)
options(crayon.enabled = FALSE)
tar_option_set(memory = "transient", garbage_collection = TRUE)

generate_data <- function() {
  true_beta <- stats::rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  x <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, length.out = n)
  y <- stats::rnorm(n, x * true_beta, 1)
  list(n = n, x = x, y = y, true_beta = true_beta)
}

list(
  tar_stan_mcmc_rep_summary(
    model,
    "model.stan",
    generate_data(), # Runs once per rep.
    batches = 5, # Number of branch targets.
    reps = 2, # Number of model reps per branch target.
    data_copy = "true_beta",
    variables = "beta",
    summaries = list(
      ~posterior::quantile2(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
    )
  )
)
```



```r 
# R console
tar_visnetwork()
```

```

### `tarchetypes`

[`tarchetypes`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/) is also part the [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/) too, and it is far more general than [`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/). Its target factories include [`tar_rep()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/reference/tar_rep.html) for arbitrary simulation studies, [`tar_render()`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/files.html#literate-programming) for [dependency-aware](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/files.html#literate-programming) literate programming, and [`tar_render_rep()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/reference/tar_render_rep.html) for [parameterized R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html). [`tar_plan()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/reference/tar_plan.html) is a [`drake_plan()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/drake_plan.html)-like target factory to help [`drake`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/) users transition to [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/).

```r 
# _targets.R file
library(targets)
library(tarchetypes)
tar_plan(
  tar_target(raw_data_file, "raw_data.csv", format = "file"),
  data = read_clean(raw_data_file),
  fit = fit_model(data),
  hist = create_plot(data)
)
```

### You can help!

The [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/) has exciting potential for  [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), [`mlr3`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/), [`keras`](https://keras.rstudio.com/), [`torch`](https://torch.mlverse.org/), PK/PD, spatial statistics, and beyond. If your field needs a friendly pipeline tool, please consider creating an [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/) package of your very own. I am [trying to make it easy](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html), and I would be eager to get in touch.

## Thanks

Volunteers drive the rOpenSci review process, and each review is an act of altruism. This was especially true for [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) because of overlap with the holidays, COVID-19, and the unusually copious workload. Despite the obstacles, everyone [delivered incredible feedback](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/401) that substantially improved [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and its documentation. [Sam Oliver](http://limnoliver.weebly.com) and [TJ Mahr](https://www.tjmahr.com) served as reviewers, and [Mauro Lepore](https://ropensci.org/author/mauro-lepore/) served as editor. Sam inspired a [section on getting started](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html#how-to-get-started), an [overview vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/articles/overview.html), [more debugging advice](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html#interactive-debugging), and a new [`tar_branches()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_branches.html) function to show branch provenance. TJ inspired a new [chapter on functions](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/functions.html), helped me [contrast the two styles of branching](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/dynamic.html#branching), and raised interesting questions about target names. Mauro was continuously diligent, responsive, thoughtful, and conscientious as he mediated the review process and ensured a successful outcome.

Thanks also to [Matt Warkentin](https://mattwarkentin.github.io), [Timing Liu](https://timingliu.com), [Miles McBain](https://milesmcbain.xyz), [Gorka Navarrete](https://github.com/gorkang), [Bruno Carlin](https://twosidesdata.netlify.com/), [Noam Ross](https://www.noamross.net/), [Kendon Bell](https://github.com/kendonB), and [others](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues) who adopted [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) early in development, proposed insightful ideas, and influenced the direction and behavior of the package.

My colleague [Richard Payne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-d-payne-2b3b0b3b/) was a serious [`drake`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/) user, and he built a proprietary [`drake_plan()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/drake_plan.html) generator for our team. His package was the major inspiration for target factories and the [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/).

Everyone who contributed to [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) is part of the creation of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/). Four years of [pull requests](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets//pulls),  [issues](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets//issues), [rOpenSci discussions](https://discuss.ropensci.org/), [RStudio Community posts](https://community.rstudio.com/), [Stack Overflow threads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drake-r-package) fundamentally shifted my thinking about the role of pipeline tools in R.
