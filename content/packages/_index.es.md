Our packages are carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that in particular lower barriers to working with local and remote scientific data sources. 
Browse [use cases](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases/) and read our [blog](/blog/) to learn how to use specific packages or contribute to their improvement. 

Curious about contributing your package? 
See our [Software Peer Review](/software-review/) page for details. 
We welcome [volunteers to review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html#whyreview) packages submitted to our open peer review process.

Below are some highlighted categories of packages. 
If you are not too sure where to look, use the [page with all packages](/packages/all/).
In any case, all packages pages have a search bar.
If a tool for your need seems missing, feel free to post on [our forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org).
