We are building a welcoming and diverse global community of R software users, developers, and research software engineers who want to make their research more open and reproducible. 
We aim to build capacity of novices, experts, and those in between. 
Participants come from across academia, government, industry, and non-profits. 
We welcome participation that adheres to our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct). 
The [rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) outlines many ways to get involved.
