We have expanded our peer review system include packages that implement statistical algorithms.  To accommodate these packages, we have developed a new set of standards specific to statistical packages, expanded our editorial board to bring in additional expertise, and developed tools to support authors and reviewers in testing and examining code. We are currently accepting submission of packages in the following 7 categories of statistical software:

1. Bayesian and Monte Carlo Routines
2. Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, and Unsupervised Learning
3. Machine Learning
4. Regression and Supervised Learning
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Summary Statistics
6. Spatial Analyses
7. Time Series Analyses

We aim to expand the system to include the following four additional categories:

8. Probability Distributions
9. Wrapper Packages
10. Networks
11. Workflow Support

Full details of procedures for preparing and submitting statistical packages for peer review are containing in our ["*Statistical Software Peer Review*" book](https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org/index.html). The system is currently in its trial phase. We ask that authors considering submission of a statistical package first via open a [pre-submission inquiry](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=B-submit-a-presubmission-inquiry.md).  Those with questions and inquiries are welcome to contact the statistical software team (Mark Padgham, mark\<at\>ropensci.org, and Noam Ross, ross\<at\>ecohealthalliance.org).
