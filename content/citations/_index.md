We used to [manually curate](/blog/2021/02/16/package-citation/#how-ropensci-tracks-package-usage) a [dataset of all citations of our packages](https://github.com/ropensci-org/ropensci_citations/).
Find below a regularly updated random sample as well as a searchable table of all citations.

If you use one of our packages, please cite it. 
E.g. if you use the magick package, run `citation("magick")` in your R console to find the appropriate text.
