R-multiverse is a new dual repository for R packages, based on infrastructure from R-universe and GitHub.
We would like to invite the developer community to contribute packages.

With R-multiverse, users have a central place for installing packages.
Automated quarterly production snapshots enforce quality.

Package maintainers retain most of the freedom and flexibility of self-publishing.
Maintainers directly control package releases through GitHub or GitLab.


R-multiverse originated from the R Consortium Repositories Working Group.
It has transparent governance, and it operates in a collaborative and open way.
It is not mature or established yet, but it is under active development, and it is ready for package contributions.
