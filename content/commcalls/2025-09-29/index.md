R-multiverse is a new community-curated dual repository for R packages, based on open-source infrastructure from R-universe and GitHub.

In R-multiverse, users have a central place for downloading packages, and package maintainers enjoy most of the freedom and flexibility of self-publishing.
Maintainers directly control package releases through GitHub/GitLab, and continuous integration automatically curates quarterly snapshots of healthy releases for production scenarios.

R-multiverse originated from the R Consortium Repositories Working Group, it has transparent governance, and it operates in a collaborative and open way.
It is not mature or established yet, but it is under active development, and it is ready for package contributions.
