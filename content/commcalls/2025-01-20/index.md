    bio: "Sunny Tseng is a Vancouver-based data scientist and PhD candidate specializing in 
    avian acoustics. She enjoys the welcoming community that open-source science brings to her career. 
    Sunny is also a scientific infographic designer, blending art with conservation research. 
    As a 2023-2024 rOpenSci Champion, she recently released her first R package, bbsTaiwan, 
    linking her passion for open science with her Taiwanese roots—and featuring her bird art 
    as the logo."

  - name: "Pascal Burkhard"
    bio: "Pascal is a geography and computer science teacher in a Swiss high school, and
    has been using R for about 15 years now. 
    Pascal mostly does visualizations for lessons (graphs and maps), but is 
    also a big fan of Quarto to create documents, presentations and books 
    that can all be organized into clean websites to use as a teaching platform."

  - name: "Yaoxiang Li"
    bio: "Yaoxiang Li is a Senior Bioinformatician at Georgetown University. 
    He has extensive experience in developing R packages, 
    focusing on making complex bioinformatics data accessible. 
    He is passionate about improving open-source software quality, 
    supporting new contributors, and promoting reproducibility in computational biology. 
    Yaoxiang is deeply interested in both statistical theory and the application 
    of machine learning in biomedical research. 
    He has made significant contributions to the R ecosystem, 
    including co-authoring several rOpenSci packages and contributing 
    to R-core through bug fixes."

Contributing to open source can be very rewarding, but also incredibly intimidating. 
When we asked about first time contributions on the rOpenSci Slack, 
people recalled the challenges and mistakes they made, 
but mostly how much they learned from and enjoyed that experience.

In this community call moderated by Hugo Gruson, our speaker, 
Yaoxiang Li will discus the importance of tests with respect to first-time contributions, and share best practices and advanced techniques for supercharging 
R package quality with testthat, Pascal Burkhard will discuss the basic git 
skills that can help to make a first contribution, and Sunny Tseng will share 
practical advice for making first contributions, common challenges and how to 
overcome them.

This event is supported by NumFOCUS Small Development Grants.
