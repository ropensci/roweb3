dateStart: 2020-03-18T09:00:00

description: We’ll start with a short talk by Julia Silge, then spend most of the
  time on Q & A with four panelists - Elin Waring, Erin Grand, Leonardo Collado-Torres,
  and Scott Chamberlain - moderated by Julia. Our panelists bring a wide range of
  perspectives so there’s something for everyone. Collectively, they have experience
  developing and maintaining passion-project packages, very popular packages, too
  many packages on CRAN, packages on Bioconductor, and taking over maintenance (and
  changing things!) of a package developed by someone else.
