rOpenSci puts ongoing effort into exploring and communicating how developers can best attract attention to their package (e.g. usage, citations, or feedback), or how to set up their repository to encourage the types of contributions they want. In this 1-hour community call, Maëlle Salmon, Hugo Gruson, and Steffi LaZerte will share tips and examples on how to do this! 

- What is the community of a package or project? 
- Include a Code of Conduct 
- What goes in your package contributing guide? Etiquette and setup
- Use your README to share your expectations with users and potential contributors
- Use issue templates
- Use issue labels to explicitly invite contributions (code or non-code) and user feedback
- Include a roadmap so potential contributors know where your package is going, what you plan to implement, and what you won’t
- What characteristics of a package or project make contributors keep coming back?

Come hear our best recommendations, and share your favorites. Stefanie Butland will moderate to get answers to your questions and we’ll have a collaborative notes doc to harness everyone's collective wisdom.

## Do you think these are great ideas, but it's hard to set aside time to put them into practice?

We’re following up this Community Call with an experiment! 

Join us for 1.5 hours Thursday, April 29, 9 AM Pacific / 16:00 UTC for our first co-working [social “Label-athon”](/events/labelathon01/).

- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Work independently, implementing some of our recommendations for your own package
- Get answers to your questions 

At the end of each session we’ll tweet links to your “help wanted” issues to help you get attention to your project. 

Our experiment includes 4 label-athons (if y’all show up, we can do more) at alternating times to accommodate our community around the world. Thursdays April 29, May 13, May 27, June 10. 

Note: This community call will *not* include tips specific to *maintaining* a package. See the recording, summary post, and collaborative notes from our past [Community Call on Maintaining an R Package](/commcalls/2020-03-18/).
