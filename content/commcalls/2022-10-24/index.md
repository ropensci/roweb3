Champions programs are designed to identify, recognize, and reward emerging leaders within a community. The [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities, which means that it needs to be sustainable and open, and built by and for all groups.

On this call _Santosh_ and _Emanuele_ will share their experience of being champions in their communities. We will highlight the benefits of being part of a champions program for you and for your community, what kind of learning, activities and opportunities an open source community champions program provides. _Yani_ will present the details of our Champion Program and answer all your question about it.
