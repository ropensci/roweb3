This is the first in a series of Community Calls we'll host throughout the year on our [statistical software review project](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-review-book/index.html).

We at rOpenSci are in the process of expanding the scope of our software peer-review system to encompass explicitly statistical software. As part of this we have developed new tools to help prepare software for submission. One of these, the [autotest package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/autotest), implements and automates rigorous testing of all function inputs, while another, the [srr package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/srr), enables documentation of, and reporting on, how and where code meets our sets of category-specific standards. Developers of packages to be submitted to this newly expanded system will be expected to apply both of these tools prior to submission. 

This one-hour event will provide an introduction to the project and feature developers who have helped to test and refine the tools, and will feature a live walk-through of the processes of applying these tools to a package.
