Join us in our quarterly Community Calls to hear about best practices, new projects, Q&As with well known developers, and to learn more about rOpenSci developments. These are free and open for anyone to attend and provide an opportunity to connect with rOpenSci community members around the world

We aim to leave at least 20 minutes for open Q&A and we use collaborative note-taking allowing participants share ideas or resources and to ask questions. All past calls were recorded and are available online.

Have an idea for a Community Call topic? Tell us what you'd like to hear about or tell us a topic you're keen to speak about in our [public ideas repository](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls).
