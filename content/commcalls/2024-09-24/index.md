[R-Universe](/r-universe/) is rOpenSci’s platform for testing, building, distributing, and discovering R packages, lead by Jeroen Ooms. 

R-Universe provides no-setup continuous integration, compilation for all platforms (including WebR!), accessible HTML R package manuals, a comprehensive API, and the ability for users or organizations to create their own “universes”.

The R universe is in continuous development and in the last time the platform has evolved improving the services it offers and adding new functionalities and features. 

In this community call, Jeroen Ooms will provide details on what R-Universe is and an update on what you can do with it today. He will also discuss the future of R-universe and how it can be used to navigate the R ecosystem.

Join us to learn more about R-Universe and how you can use it to improve your R package development workflow.
