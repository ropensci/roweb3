The [{targets}](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package is a pipeline tool for Statistics and data science in R. With {targets}, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. {targets} learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.

On this call Will, Eric and Joel will share their experience putting **{targets} into action**. Eric will share with us _Using {targets} with HPC_ and Joel will talk about _Using {targets} for bioinformatics pipelines_, then Will will demonstrate _Debugging {targets} pipelines_.
