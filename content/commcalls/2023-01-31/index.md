    bio:  Eric Scott is a Scientific Programmer & Educator at University of Arizona.  He has a background in chemical ecology and plant ecology and is a regular contributor to the {webchem} package.  He has now attempted to make it easy to set up {targets} to harness the power of HPC from the comfort of an RStudio window at three universities—and succeeded at two!

The [{targets}](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package is a pipeline tool for Statistics and data science in R. With {targets}, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. {targets} learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.

On this call _Will_, _Eric_ and _Joel_ will share their experience putting **targets into action**. _Eric_ will share with us _Using {targets} with HPC_ and _Joel_ will talk about _using {targets} for bioinformatics pipelines_, then _Will_ will show us how to _Debugging {targets} pipelines_.
