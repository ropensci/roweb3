Champions programs are designed to identify, recognize, and reward emerging leaders within a community. The [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities, which means that it needs to be sustainable and open, and built by and for all groups.

On this call _Beatriz_, _ _ and _ _ will share their experience of being rOpenSci mentors and champions. 
We will highlight the benefits of being part of the program for you and for your community, what kind of learning,
