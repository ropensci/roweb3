The R-universe platform is a new umbrella project under which rOpenSci experiments with new ideas for improving publication and discovery of research software in R. The system provides an array of services to users and developers of R packages, with integrated measuring and monitoring tools to analyze the state and evolution of the ecosystem. The platform is based around a modern build infrastructure, which enables users or research groups to seamlessly set up automated R package repositories for publishing software directly to users.

Jeroen will introduce the R-universe, including providing a user perspective, and share how we think this sort of tooling can help scientists publish and discover research software.

This 1-hour event, moderated by Karthik Ram, will have at least 20 minutes for audience Q & A.
