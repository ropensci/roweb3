### Setting up your own R universe

Earlier this year we announced [R-universe](https://ropensci.org/r-universe/): a project by rOpenSci under which we experiment with various ideas for improving publication and discovery of research software packages in R. The platform is under heavy development, Jeroen's [talk at rstudio-conf 2021](https://resources.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/monitoring-health-and-impact-of-open-source-projects/) outlines some of our ambitions for the effort.

During the initial pilot, we were testing the system using published packages [listed on CRAN](https://github.com/r-universe-org/cran-to-git) and the [rOpenSci registry](https://ropensci.org/packages/).
Now, we are gradually opening up the system to allow users to include any R packages into their own universe, to provide users with a personal space where they can publish experimental software, development versions, [research compendia](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/04/09/r-universe-articles/) packages.

In this community call, we explain the basic steps of setting up your own universe, and getting started with publishing packages and articles on your [personal subdomain](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev). We are interested in hearing your thoughts and ideas on how this infrastructure can improve how researchers publish and discover R packages and related content.

This 1-hour event, moderated by Karthik Ram, will have at least 20 minutes for audience Q & A.
