## Background and role context

rOpenSci seeks a _Community Manager_ to support and build our vibrant and inclusive community of researchers and software engineers and help expand the scope and impact of our work in open science.  

rOpenSci's mission is to expand access to scientific data and promote a culture of reproducible research and sustainable research software, primarily in the R programming language.  We do this through the development of software technical infrastructure and cultivating a community of mutual support amongst researchers and research software engineers.  We're an established community with more than a decade of history, more than 300 packages and hundreds of members having an impact on open and reproducible research. We're looking for a new community manager to help us to consolidate our existing efforts and ensure that we're supporting an increasingly diverse membership.

In your role as the community manager, you will be the face of the organization welcoming new members. You will help new and experienced members collaborate with each other and contribute to communal projects such as software peer-review, R infrastructure development, and internationalization.  You will help guide the direction of the organization by organizing community events and partnerships and actively gathering input about member needs and emerging priorities.  You will also play a key role in implementing rOpenSci's [new project empowering Community Leaders from historically excluded groups (HEGs) in collaboration](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/) with the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement ([CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org/)). 


## Key responsibilities

Specifically, your responsibilities will include:

* **Community Engagement**
    * Supporting the technical community by facilitating our online spaces (Slack, forums, Twitter), onboarding new members, and connecting researchers and developers with resources within the community.
    * Organizing peer-mentorship groups and facilitating tutorials, office hours, and 1-to-1 training between fellows, staff, and community members.

* **Communications**
    * Writing and cultivating a steady stream of community contributions to our blog in both technical and community topics, and maintaining our social media feeds (primarily Twitter).
    * Writing and editing documentation to help members navigate our community and technical projects.
    * Facilitating our internal staff meetings and communications.

* **Program management**
    * Organizing events such as community calls and co-working sessions.
    * Working with rOpenSci staff and partners to develop and implement technical, community, and leadership skills training.
    * Supporting project evaluation, reporting, and new project development.

* **Outreach and advocacy**
    * Acting as a liaison to other community groups and historically excluded groups (HEGs) affinity organizations.
    * Representing rOpenSci in online spaces and conferences, giving presentations, and engaging with the research community to support our mission and recruit new contributors.

## About You

Here's what we're looking for in our community manager. Please briefly address all of these in your cover letter:

-   **_A background in science and a passion for open science_**. Although prior research experience is not necessary, you must have a bachelor's degree equivalent or greater in the sciences and an understanding of the ecosystem of scientific publication, open data, and reproducibility where we aim to make our impact.

-   **_Demonstrated experience in community-building_**.  Strong communication and engagement skills are a must. Show us that you know how to bring people together to achieve common goals and mutual support.  This can include organizing participatory events such as workshops or hackathons, running a technical support group, and/or building community in online spaces such as forums, chat groups, social media. 
-   **_Comfort with open source and technical topics_**. While the position does not involve any software development, our community is primarily researchers and software engineers using the R language and tools such as Git and GitHub.   These are both the core collaborative work of our community and the stack on which we base our internal processes.  You must be comfortable enough to use these tools and/or learn them with the support of our team. Experience in the R language and community is valuable but not required — enthusiasm for learning and experience in other computer languages or technical communities is sufficient.
-  **_A commitment to diversity and inclusion_**. This work will involve collaborating with partners and leaders in affinity groups for historically excluded communities and two-way work to facilitate peer mentorship and leadership to improve diversity and inclusion in the open-source ecosystem.  A strong commitment to values of diversity, equity, and inclusion is a must. Experience as an organizer of or contributor to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs is highly valued. 

-  **_Comfort with evolving projects and providing support and advocacy in a service-oriented manner_**. Building community is often responsive work that requires knowing when to gather input and when to take action.  

-   **_Comfortable with remote work_**. We are a fully globally remote team and work asynchronously. We’ll support costs related to a home office or co-working space.  

Other desired qualifications include written and spoken proficiency in Spanish, as Spanish-speaking communities are a key constituency.
