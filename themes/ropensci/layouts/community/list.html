            Our quarterly community calls are open to everyone. They're an opportunity to connect with rOpenSci community members around the world. Join us for lively discussions with experts on both technical and social topics, like development, review, security and maintenance of R packages, applications of our packages in open science, or developing a code of conduct. Every Community Call becomes a rich resource with video and collaborative notes.
