This is the Quarto (.qmd) template for a blog post or tech note. 
To generate your post with just Markdown (.md), use that template instead.

[Quarto docs for Hugo](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/hugo.html).

Throughout this template, including the YAML, 
you should change "post-template" to the slug of your post, 
and "2019-06-04" to your publication date.

Save this file under /content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.qmd in the local copy of your roweb3 fork.

The figure paths in the resulting Markdown will already be valid so you won't need to edit the Markdown file.

## Section heading in sentence case

Citation of the primary literature[^1]. 

Citation of a website[^2]. 

Citation of an R package[^3].

### Subsection heading

We recommend the use of [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to include images, videos, gists, etc. 

**Add an image** by using a Hugo shortcode. The image is saved under `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/name-of-image.png`.

{{{< figure src = "name-of-image.png" width = "400" alt = "this is the alternative text" >}}}

Consult the Technical Guidelines for tips on changing image size, alignment, and for advice on alternative text.

Below is another image, a plot generated by a code chunk, so you might see how to add alternative text in this case.

```{r chunkname}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"
#| fig-alt: "alternative text please make it informative"
plot(1:10)
```

Once this file is rendered the plot above will be inserted with the correct syntax.
